SEC. 61.14.  SPECIAL ENGINEERING FEE.



   (Added by Ord. No. 184,054, Eff. 3/6/16.)



 



   For all Bureau of Engineering permits and services identified in this
Code for which a fee is charged, and which require Bureau staff time for plan
checking, field investigation, project evaluation, or other work or effort in
addition to that which is ordinarily required for the permit or service for
which the fee is charged, the following fees shall apply:



 



   (a)   For Bureau of Engineering services that require 16 or fewer
additional hours of Bureau staff time, a Special Engineering Fee of $149 per
hour shall be charged for each hour of additional service, up to a maximum of
16 hours total; and



 



   (b)   For Bureau of Engineering services that require more than 16
additional hours of Bureau staff time, the Bureau will charge and collect the
actual cost of its services pursuant to the provisions of Section 61.15,
unless a provision of this Code provides for a different fee amount.



 



   The provisions of this section shall not apply to any Bureau of
Engineering fee that requires payment of actual Bureau costs rather than a
fixed pre-determined fee amount.



 



 



SEC. 61.15.  ACTUAL COST SPECIAL ENGINEERING SERVICES.



   (Added by Ord. No. 182,237, Eff. 9/28/12.)



 



   For all Bureau of Engineering permits or other services identified in
this Chapter for which a fee is charged, and which require Bureau staff to
provide more than 16 hours of time for plan checking, field investigation,
project evaluation, or other work or effort in addition to that which is
ordinarily required for the permit or service for which the fee is charged,
or for requested Bureau services for projects not specifically described in
this Code, the Bureau shall charge and collect a fee in an amount sufficient
to pay the Bureau's actual cost of providing its services.  The actual cost
amount determination shall include, but not be limited to, all direct and
indirect labor costs, retirement and overhead costs.  An applicant for any
permit or services subject to the provisions of this Section must pay, before
the Bureau of Engineering provides any services, a deposit in an amount that
the Bureau estimates will be the actual cost of providing its services.



 



   For Bureau of Engineering services provided pursuant to the provisions
of this Section, if before completion of providing the requested services the
Bureau determines that additional funds are needed to compensate the Bureau
for the actual cost of providing the services, the Bureau may halt all work
on the project for which the application was made and require the applicant
to pay the amount that the Bureau estimates will be needed to compensate the
Bureau for the actual cost of providing the requested services.  At the
conclusion of providing the requested services, if actual Bureau costs are
less than the amount deposited, the applicant shall be refunded the
difference.  The Bureau of Engineering shall not issue or approve any permit
until all monies owed pursuant to the provisions of this Section are paid.

accompanied by a plan, in triplicate, showing the location and dimensions of
each proposed excavation and such other details as the Bureau of Engineering
may require.  The applicant shall supply additional copies of the plan if
requested by the Bureau of Engineering for checking or inspection purposes. 
The Bureau of Engineering shall review the plan, and shall approve the plan
if the Bureau determines it to be satisfactory.  Prior to approval of a
plan, the Bureau of Engineering shall determine whether to require any permit
conditions or special restrictions, and such conditions or restrictions will
be incorporated into the permit.  If a plan shows a permanent installation
to be made in the area of a public street, a copy shall be placed in the
electronic files of the City Engineer as a public record, and an approved
duplicate will be used for inspection purposes.  Any excavation made or
facility installed shall be located in strict conformance with the location
shown on the plan.

   (d)   Surveying.  (Amended by Ord. No. 182,237, Eff. 9/28/12.)  In
reviewing an application for a permit pursuant to the provisions of this
Section, the Bureau of Engineering may require an applicant to conduct
surveys if the Bureau determines that surveys are needed to insure that the
proposed excavations or facilities to be installed would be located as
described in the permit application or shown on the accompanying plat.



 



   (e)   Authority to Occupy Street Area.  No person, nor any
department or officer of this City, shall make any installation in street
areas without legal authority granted by franchise or otherwise to occupy and
use such areas for the purpose of such installations, regardless of whether
or not such person is required to secure a permit under the provisions of
this section.



 



   (f)   Liability Insurance.  (Amended by Ord. No. 182,237, Eff.
9/28/12.)



 



   1.   Insurance Required.  A permit to excavate issued pursuant to
the provisions of this Section shall not be issued until the applicant has
filed with the City Engineer a policy of protective liability insurance
naming the City as an insured or a co-insured with the permittee.  The
policy of insurance shall insure the City and its departments, officers and
employees, while acting with the scope of their duties, against all claims
arising from or in connection with the operations of the permittee, or any
contractor or subcontractor of the permittee, undertaken pursuant to the
provisions of the permit.



 



   2.   Exception.  The provisions of this Subsection shall not apply
to the Federal Government, the State of California, any county, city or
county, municipal corporation, irrigation district, school district, district
established by law, any political subdivision of the Federal Government or
State of California, any public utility regulated by the Public Utilities
Commission of the State of California, or any contractor or subcontractor
while performing work under contract to any such entity pursuant to a permit
issued under the provisions of this Section.



 



   3.   Amounts.  The policy of insurance required by the provisions
of this Subsection shall provide the following minimum coverage:



 



      Bodily Injury:      $250,000 for each person



               $500,000 for each occurrence



               $500,000 aggregate - products and completed
operations



 



      Property Damage:   $100,000 for each occurrence



               $250,000 aggregate



 



   A combined single limit policy with aggregate limits in the amount of
$1 million will be considered equivalent to the required minimum limits.



 



   The coverage amounts identified in this Subdivision are minimum
amounts, and the Bureau of Engineering has the authority to require coverage
in larger amounts where it determines that such coverage is required to
adequately protect the City.



 



   4.   Deposit or Bond Where Lateral Support is Imperiled.  If a
proposed excavation on private property would imperil the lateral support of
a public street or improvements on a public street, in addition to providing
the insurance required by the provisions of this Subsection, a permittee must
provide to the Bureau of Engineering cash or a surety bond in an amount
determined by the Bureau to compensate the City for damage that may be caused
to City property by the excavation.  If a bond is provided, it must be
executed to the satisfaction of the Bureau of Engineering and approved as to
form and legality by the City Attorney.  The bond must be in effect for a
minimum of two years after completion of the permitted work, and if cash is
provided instead of a bond, the Bureau of Engineering shall keep the cash for
a minimum of two years after completion of the permitted work.  The Bureau
of Engineering has the authority to modify for good cause the provisions of
this Subdivision pertaining to the length of time it maintains custody of a
cash deposit or the length of the effectiveness of a surety bond.

SEC. 62.03.  EXCAVATIONS IN AND ADJACENT TO STREETS – LOCATIONS AND
RESTRICTIONS.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 150,478, Eff. 2/6/78.)



 



   (a)   Restricted Area.  The area in a street between the face of an
existing or future curb and four feet back of such curb face is reserved for
use by the Department of Public Works. Installation of facilities within, or
other use of, this area will not be permitted except as provided herein. The
Board may issue permits as provided in Section 62.02 for installations in or
use of this area. Such permits are subject to revocation by the Board at any
time it becomes necessary to construct a public work of any kind within the
area.



 



   EXCEPTION:  Restriction on the use of such area will not apply to
service connections, meters, pole installations, or City-owned facilities
used for governmental purposes. However, the installation of poles may not be
permitted, or poles being maintained in street areas may be ordered removed,
when territory adjacent to such street is provided with a public alley or
with an easement or private right of way specifically set aside for the
purpose of erecting poles therein.



 



   Poles which are erected and maintained in streets shall be set as close
as practicable to the back of the curb unless some other point is approved or
designated by the Board.



 



   (b)   Depth of Substructure Installations.  (Amended by Ord. No.
186,444, Eff. 1/2/20.)



 



   1.   All service pipes, main line pipes, conduits, ducts, tunnels,
or other structures, except manholes and vaults, shall be installed in the
following manner:



 



   (A)   In a Roadway or alley.  All parts shall be installed at a
depth of at least 24 inches below the established grade of the gutter of the
roadway or alley;



 



   (B)   In a Roadway of a major or secondary highway.  All parts
shall be installed at a depth of at least 30 inches below the established
grade of the gutter of roadway; or



 



   (C)   Between the Curb face and the Property line, or in any other
Public Place or Easement.  All parts shall be installed at a depth of at
least 16 inches below the surface.



 



   Notwithstanding the above requirements, any new or relocated
installation intended to carry unstable substances shall be constructed at a
depth of at least 42 inches below the established grade of the gutter of the
roadway or alley.



 



   2.   Micro-trenching Installations.  Telecommunication or other low
voltage utilities may be installed via Micro-trenching when approved by the
City Engineer.  These shall be installed in the following manner:



 



   (A)   In a Roadway or Alley.  All parts shall be installed in a
roadway or alley at a depth of at least one inch below the existing asphalt
layer or as otherwise required by the City Engineer; or

   In lieu of the area as defined under Section 62.06 A.1., substructure
installations constructed by micro-trenching shall have a Street Damage
Restoration Fee assessment area that equals one foot times the length of the
excavation cut.



 



   EXCEPTION:  If, by reason of the existence of other installations or
the proposed construction of any public work, a proposed substructure
installation cannot be made below the minimum depths stated in subsection (b)
above, the Board may, upon presentation of evidence of the necessity therefor
or because of the public benefit to accrue therefrom, grant a permit for an
installation at a lesser depth.



 



   (c)   Tanks.



 



   1.   Permits Required.  No person shall install any storage tank in
any public street without obtaining a permit from the Board to do so in
compliance with the provisions of Section 62.02.



 



   The issuance of a permit by the Board to excavate in a public street
for the purpose of installing an underground storage tank in no way relieves
such permittee of the necessity of obtaining an additional permit for such
installation from the Fire Department and complying with all applicable
provisions of Article 7 of Chapter 5 of this Code.



 



   2.   Agreement to Remove.  Permission to maintain a tank in a
public street may be revoked by the Board at any time, and upon such
revocation, the tank shall be removed. As a condition precedent to the
issuance of a permit to install such a tank in a public street, the applicant
shall record with the County Recorder of the County of Los Angeles an
agreement, approved as to form by the City Attorney, holding the City
harmless from any claims arising out of the use of such tank, and setting
forth the duties and responsibilities of the owner of the adjacent property
to remove the tank without expense to the City when so ordered by the Board.
Such agreement shall be a covenant running with the land and binding upon the
owner and his successors, heirs and assigns.



 



   3.   Abandonment of Tanks in Place.  When not contrary to the
public health, safety or welfare, the Board may allow the installation to be
only partially removed, and the balance to be abandoned in place, or may
permit an unused tank to be filled as provided in Article 7 of Chapter 5 of
this Code, and to be abandoned in place.



 



   4.   Board May Remove or Abandon Tanks.  If within 20 days after
service by the Board of a notice to remove or fill an underground storage
tank, the owner or his heirs, successors, or assigns as the case may be,
fails, refuses, or neglects to remove or fill such tank, as directed by the
Board, the Board may perform the necessary work and recover the cost of the
work from such person.



 



   5.   Maximum Capacity of Tanks.  The maximum capacity of any
storage tank that may be installed in a public street is 4000 gallons.



 



   (d)   Tunnels.



 



   1.   Rights of Franchise Holders.  No tunnel structure shall be
constructed in any location or any manner which will prevent the lawful use
or occupation of a street by persons occupying it under the authority of
lawfully existing franchises.



 



   2.   Inspection of Tunnels.  Every tunnel structure constructed
shall be subject to inspection at all times by the City Engineer and the
Board.



 



   3.   Revocation of Permission to Maintain Tunnels.  Permission
granted for the construction of a tunnel structure in a public street may be
revoked by the Board at any time; and the City reserves the right to resume
possession of any portion of any street occupied by a tunnel structure at any
time the Council determines that such is necessary or advantageous to the use
of the street by the City.



 



   4.   Installation of Machinery in Tunnels.  Machinery, boilers, or
engines shall not be placed in any tunnel structure constructed under the
surface of any street except that, subject to the approval of Council,
conveyor systems may be installed within such tunnel structures.



 



   (e)   Location Maps and Plans.  (Amended by Ord. No. 150,478, Eff.
2/6/78.)  The person owning, using, controlling or having an interest in any
subsurface installation, other than a service connection, in any public
street shall file with the City Engineer within 60 days after the completing
of such installation, a corrected set of maps or atlas sheets showing the
installation. Such map shall be drawn to a scale of not more than 200 feet to
the inch.



 



   In the event such subsurface installation is for the purpose of
carrying an unstable substance, as-built plans and profiles, showing the
location, depth and size of the completed installation, in a manner
acceptable to the City Engineer, shall also be submitted within said 60-day
period.



 



   Whenever such subsurface installation in a public street or sidewalk is
abandoned or the use thereof is discontinued, the person owning, using,
controlling or having an interest therein shall, within 60 days after such
abandonment, file with the City Engineer a map showing in detail the location
of the abandoned installation.



 



 



SEC. 62.03.1.  NOTIFICATION AND LOCATION REQUIREMENTS.



   (Added by Ord. No. 150,478, Eff. 2/6/78.)



 



   Each permittee shall ascertain the location of any subsurface
installation within the street at or adjacent to the location of the
permittee’s proposed excavation and shall further ascertain whether any
such installation carries an unstable substance. Before any work of
excavation is commenced, the permittee shall, at least two working days
before the commencement of such work, notify the owner of any subsurface
installation as to the location of the permittee’s proposed excavation and
the date and time when work is scheduled to commence, or shall notify any
central clearing house established for such purpose, or both, as such
notification may be directed by the City Engineer.



 



   In the event the proposed excavation is ascertained to be adjacent to
and within six feet of the location of a subsurface installation carrying any
unstable substance, the permittee shall cause potholes to be excavated as
follows:



 



   1.   Where any such subsurface installation crosses a street
transversely at the location of the proposed excavation, at least two
potholes shall be excavated at each such transverse crossing; and



 



   2.   Where any such subsurface installation runs longitudinal to the
street, potholes shall be excavated at intervals of 100 feet.



 



   Potholes shall be excavated at closer intervals than 100 feet or in
excess of the minimum number required at transverse crossings if such
additional potholes are needed in order to adequately locate any such
subsurface installation. Power tools shall not be used for excavating
potholes except for breaking pavement. Other approved locating methods may be
substituted for potholing provided that the permittee has first obtained
written permission therefor from the City Engineer.



 



   The permittee shall hold harmless and indemnify the City, its officers
agents and employees of and from any and all liability or responsibility for
any property damage or loss or injury or death to any person arising out of
or occurring as the proximate result of any of the excavation.

   (Amended by Ord. No. 171,924, Eff. 3/27/98.)



 



   (a)   Work Subject to Provisions Governing Performance. 
Performance of work authorized by an excavation permit issued under the
provisions of Section 62.02 shall be governed by the provisions of this
section.



 



   EXCEPTION:  Performance of work in connection with the installation of
sewer or storm drain connections shall be governed by the provisions of
Section 64.17 and performance of work being done under the Permit “A” and
Permit “B” provisions of this article or under contract with the Board is
governed by the provisions of the current Standard Specifications of the
Department of Public Works.



 



   (b)   Notification of Start of Work.  The permittee shall notify
the Bureau of Contract Administration, not less than one working day prior to
starting work on any excavation which will extend 100 square feet or more in
area and is governed by the provisions of this section.  In the case of an
excavation being made by a department of this City, such notification shall
be made by the responsible supervisor.



 



   (c)   Prosecution of Work.  Unless otherwise provided in special
conditions on the permit governing the dates and hours during which work is
to done, the work of making and refilling an excavation shall be prosecuted
diligently and continuously until completion so as not to obstruct traffic on
any roadway or sidewalk longer than is actually necessary.



 



   If the responsible party shall fail, refuse, or neglect to promptly
refill any excavation or to promptly perform any other necessary work, the
Board may perform such work, and in cases where funds are on deposit with the
City in connection with the permit under which the excavation or work is
being performed, the cost of the work performed by the Board may be deducted
from such deposit.



 



   (d)   Permits to Be Kept on Job Site.  Except for work being done
prior to the issuance of a permit as authorized by the emergency provisions
of Subdivisions 6 of the Subsection (a) of Section 62.02, the original or a
copy of any permit for the making and backfilling of an excavation shall be
kept at all times while work is in progress at the location for which such
permit was granted.  Upon demand, such permit shall be shown to any member
or inspector of the Board or to any police officer.



 



   (e)   Lateral Support.  All excavations shall be performed and all
facilities constructed and maintained so as to afford lateral, sublateral,
adjacent, and overhead support to the surrounding embankments and 
structures.  The approval of any plans submitted or the issuance of a permit
does not relieve  the permittee from full responsibility for any damage or
injury caused by his operations.  Neither the City nor any of its officers
or employees shall be liable or responsible for any such damage or injuries.



 



   (f)   Safety.  All work in any public street, public place, or
public easement shall be performed in strict accordance with the safety
provisions of Title 8 of the State of California Administrative Code. 
Failure by a permittee to adhere to such safety provisions will be cause for
the Board to impound the deposit or bond submitted by the permittee in
compliance with Section 62.02 until all charges by the City have been met.



 



   (g)   Methods of Removal.  No material shall be removed from any
street in any manner which would render such street impassable or dangerous
to public travel.



 



   (h)   Excavations Through Cement Surfaces.  When an excavation is
to be made through a sidewalk or other Portland cement concrete surface, all
work shall be done in accordance with the latest specifications established
by the Board or the City Engineer.



 



   (i)   Provisions for Traffic Safety.  Unless otherwise authorized
by the Board, anyone making an excavation in any roadway or sidewalk shall
provide and maintain safe crossings for vehicular and pedestrian traffic. 
Crossings for vehicular traffic shall be made at all street and alley
intersections.  If an excavation is made across an alley, or the roadway
portion of any other street, at least one safe crossing for vehicles shall be
provided and maintained.  Pedestrian crossings shall be separate from
vehicular crossings and shall be provided with handrails.  One such
pedestrian crossing shall be provided at each street intersection, and at
intervals of not more than 300 feet.  If an excavation is made across the
sidewalk portion of any street, a crossing for pedestrians shall be provided
and maintained.



 



   Additional traffic provisions, particularly in important traffic
arteries, may be specified by the City Engineer.  Provisions so specified
will become a condition of the permit and be binding upon the permittee.



 



   (j)   Traffic Control in Work Areas.  Warning signs, barriers,
barricades, guidance devices and lights, shall be furnished, placed, and
maintained in conformance with the current manual entitled “Work Area
Traffic Control Handbook (WATCH)” approved by the Board.



 



   If the warning signs, lights, and devices required under this section
are not promptly provided, the Board may provide them; the cost of such work
performed by the Board may be recovered in the manner provided in Section
62.05(a) of this Code.



 



   (k)   Site Maintenance.



 



   (1)   Access to Hydrants and Water Valves.  Free access must be
provided at all times to all fire hydrants and water valves.



 



   (2)   Confinement of Excavated Material.  When excavated material
is placed adjacent to the excavation, it shall be placed in such a manner as
to economize space and minimize interference with traffic.  If necessary,
such material shall be confined by suitable bulkheads or other devices.  If
the street is not of sufficient width to hold excavated material without
using part of an adjacent walkway, a passageway at least one-half the width
of such walkway shall be kept open at all times.



 



   (3)   Maintenance of Gutters.  All gutters shall be maintained free
and unobstructed for the full depth of the adjacent curb and for at least one
foot in width from the face of such curb at the gutter line.  Whenever a
gutter crosses an intersecting street, an adequate waterway shall be provided
and maintained.



 



   (l)   Backfilling.  Unless a specific backfill material is required
on the permit, backfill material, installation and compaction shall be in
accordance with the latest standards and specifications established by the
Board or the City Engineer.



 



   (m)   Resurfacing.



 



   (1)   Temporary Resurfacing.  Except as otherwise provided herein,
after completion of backfilling operations, the portion of the paved surface
of any public street or public place excavated or damaged shall be
immediately resurfaced with temporary resurfacing material by the
permittee.  Temporary resurfacing shall consist of premixed bituminous
material conforming to the specifications for material to be used for such
purpose contained in the current Standard Specifications of the Department of
Public Works.  Such resurfacing after compaction shall be not less than one
inch thick in sidewalk areas and not less than two inches thick in driveway
and roadway areas.  Its surface after compaction shall conform to the
finished surface of the roadway or sidewalk.  The material shall be
compacted so that it is dense and smooth enough to be safe for either
pedestrians or vehicular traffic as the case may be, at the maximum speed
permitted by law.



 



   (2)   Maintenance of Temporary Resurfacing.  The permittee shall
maintain the surfacing so that it is safe for pedestrian or vehicular traffic
until the excavation is permanently resurfaced.



 



   If it is impracticable to maintain the surface of the backfill in a
safe condition for pedestrian travel or vehicular traffic, the permittee
shall maintain barriers and lights around it until the excavation has been
resurfaced.



 



   (3)   Permanent Resurfacing by City.  Unless otherwise authorized
herein or specifically authorized by the Board and indicated by the permit,
the improved surface of a street excavated or damaged in connection with work
being performed by authority of a permit issued under the provisions of
Section 62.02 will be permanently surfaced by the permittee.  The permittee
shall mark each such resurfacing in the manner prescribed by the City
Engineer and shall be responsible for the integrity of such resurfacing for a
period of five years from installation.



 



   (4)   Permanent Resurfacing by Permittee.  In cases where permanent
resurfacing by permittee is required, the permanent resurfacing may be placed
immediately in lieu of placing and maintaining temporary resurfacing.



 



   The Board may require the area to be permanently resurfaced immediately
after completion of the backfilling where such is practical and in the
interest of the public safety and welfare.  Such requirement shall be
specified on the permit.



 



   A utility issued a permit for the drilling of leakage detection holes
shall make immediate repair to said holes with its own crews, at its own
expense, and in the manner prescribed by the Board.



 



   When an excavation is made to install, remove, or abandon a pole or a
structure which forms a portion of the finished surface of a sidewalk or
concrete driveway, in lieu of the placement of temporary resurfacing, the
person or department of the City making the excavation may permanently
restore the surface of the sidewalk or driveway to the nearest scoring line
of the square or squares of which the pole does or did occupy or the
structure forms or did form a portion of the finished surface.  All such
restoration shall be made by removing and replacing the entire portion of the
walk or driveway between the nearest scoring lines.  The surface of an alley
may be similarly restored when the purpose of the excavation therein is the
installation, relocation or removal of a pole or pole anchor.  Construction
of the walk, driveway or alley surface shall be done in accordance with the
current Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction.



 



   (5)   Permit Required for Resurfacing by Permittee.  Except as
provided herein, all permanent resurfacing done by permittee in connection
with a permit issued under the provisions of Section 62.02, shall be done
under a Class “A” permit secured in compliance with Section 62.105 of
this Code.  All permits obtained for street excavations and subsequent
resurfacing activities shall not be in lieu of but in addition to all permits
required pursuant to Sections 62.02, 62.04, 64.17 and the Street Damage
Restoration Fee Ordinance contained in the LAMC.

   (a)   Excavation Permit Fees.  (Amended by Ord. No. 184,054, Eff.
3/6/16.)



 



   1.   Fixed Fee Permits.  For an excavation of 1,000 square feet of
area or less, except for fees subject to the provisions of Subdivision 2. of
this subsection, the Bureau of Engineering shall charge and collect the
following permit and inspection fees:



 



   (aa)   Excavation Utility (U) Permit.  Excavation utility (U)
permits are issued to public utilities regulated by the Public Utilities
Commission of the State of California, and except for permits subject to the
provisions of Subdivision 2. of this subsection, the fee to process an
excavation (U) permit is $191.  The fee to inspect each U permit of an
excavation area of 99 square feet or less is $114, and the fee to inspect an
area of more than 99 square feet, but less than 1,000 square feet, is $2.20
per square foot.



 



   (bb)   Excavation (E) Permit.  Except for permits subject to the
provisions of Subdivision 2. of this subsection, the fee to process an
excavation (E) permit is $438.  The fee to inspect each E permit of an
excavation area of 99 square feet or less is $114, and the fee to inspect an
area of more than 99 square feet, but less than 1,000 square feet, is $2.20
per square foot.



 



   (cc)   Special Inspection Charges.  In addition to the fees
identified in Paragraphs (aa) and (bb) of this subdivision, the Bureau of
Engineering may, when the Bureau of Engineering or the Bureau of Contract
Administration determines that additional inspections beyond those ordinarily
required in overseeing work permitted by an excavation utility (U) permit or
excavation (E) permit are required, charge a fee for additional
inspections.  The fee for conducting additional inspections pursuant to the
provisions of this paragraph is $95 per hour, except that there will be a
minimum four hour charge of $380 for inspections on weekends or on any day
determined to be a holiday pursuant to the provisions of Section 4.119 of the
Los Angeles Administrative Code.



 



   The charges authorized by this paragraph shall apply to all fixed fees
imposed or collected by the Bureau of Engineering for the issuance or

Engineering or the Bureau of Contract Administration, requires inspections in
addition to those paid for by the underlying fee.



 



   2.   Actual Cost Permits.  The fee to process a (U) or (E)
excavation permit for an excavation of more than 1,000 square feet in area,
or to process a (U) or (E) excavation permit for an excavation of 1,000
square feet or less in area where the Bureau of Engineering determines that
due to the complexity of the permitted work it would cost more to issue and
administer a permit than would be collected pursuant to the provisions of
Subdivision 1. of this subsection, is the actual cost of services provided by
the City for issuance and oversight of the permit and the permitted project,
except for costs that may be incurred by a Proprietary Department subject to
the provisions of Article VI of the City Charter, and except for the Street
Damage Restoration Fee and the Slurry Seal Damage Restoration Fee.  The
actual cost determination shall include, but not be limited to, all direct
and indirect labor costs, retirement and overhead costs, costs for plan
checking and engineering services, project inspection costs, and the costs of
testing materials.  Before the Bureau of Engineering may issue a permit
subject to the provisions of this subdivision, the applicant must deposit
with the Bureau an amount that the Bureau estimates will be the actual costs
owed pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision.



 



   For permits and projects that are subject to the provisions of this
subdivision, if before completion of the permitted project the Bureau of
Engineering determines that additional funds are needed to compensate the
City for the actual cost of issuance and oversight of the permit and
permitted project, the City may halt all work on the project for which the
application was made and require the applicant to pay the amount that the
Bureau estimates will be needed to compensate the City for the actual cost of
providing its services.  At the conclusion of providing the requested
services, if actual costs to the City are less than the amount deposited, the
applicant shall be refunded the difference.  The City shall not approve any
permitted project until all monies owed pursuant to the provisions of this
subdivision are paid.  Notwithstanding the first sentence of this
subdivision, the City reserves the right to impose additional fees and
charges for services provided or costs incurred that were not included in the
basis of the determination of the actual cost of City services.



 



   3.   Tie-Back fees.  In addition to the fees imposed pursuant to
the provisions of Subdivisions 1. and 2. of this subsection, the following
fees shall apply to excavations requiring shoring that contain tie-backs:



 



   (aa)   For each tie-back installed in a public right-of-way, a fee
of $623.



 



   (bb)   For each de-tensioned anchor rod left in place less than 20
feet below the street surface within a public right-of-way, a fee of $2,101.



 



   4.   Resurfacing Charges.  When an excavation subject to the
provisions of Paragraph (bb) of Subdivision 1. of this subsection requires
the resurfacing of public streets or alleys, or replacing sidewalks, curbs or
gutters, the Bureau of Engineering shall charge and collect applicable fees
identified in Subsection (b) of Section 62.109.



 



   (b)   Resurfacing Charges.



 



   1.   Schedule of Fees.  (Amended by Ord. No. 157,341, Eff. 2/13/83.)



 



   aa.   The Board, with concurrence of the Director of the Office of
Administrative and Research Services (Amended by Ord. No. 173,363, Eff.
7/29/00, Oper. 7/1/00.) shall determine on a regular basis, the verifiable
costs of the City for services provided by the City whenever the improved
surface of an excavated or damaged street is replaced by the Board, or the
restoration of an unimproved surface of a street is subject to inspection by
the Board. Those costs shall be used by the Board to develop, and at any time
during each fiscal year but not later than April 1 the Board shall adopt a
cost recovery schedule of applicable charges necessary to recover City costs
of inspection and other services performed with respect to a specific type of
work or improvement.



 



   For the purposes of this section, the word “excavation,” or any
derivation thereof, shall mean each single continuous broken surface area of
a street, sidewalk, driveway, curb, pavement or gutter.



 



   The schedule of charges shall be based upon verifiable costs of surface
replacement or restoration, including inspection costs, direct labor and
material costs, retirement costs on direct labor, and departmental and
general City overhead applicable to the inspection or the type of work or
improvement involved. It shall take into consideration the number of permits
issued and affected by those charges within the period of time used for
reference in the development of charges. Charges for unimproved areas or
areas permanently resurfaced by a permittee, for asphalt concrete pavement,
for concrete pavement, gutter, or driveway, and for concrete sidewalks shall
be measured at a rate per square foot; for concrete curbs at a rate per
linear foot; and for leakage detection holes and for stake holes, at a rate
for each hole.



 



   The schedule shall also provide for, and the Board shall collect, a
minimum charge applicable to each particular type of work or improvement
otherwise in effect under the schedule. The minimum charge shall be
calculated on the following basis:



 



   (1)   For unimproved areas or areas permanently resurfaced by a
permittee, a minimum charge equal to the City charge in effect for a unit of
100 square feet of such work;



 



   (2)   For asphalt concrete pavement, and for a concrete pavement
gutter, driveway, or sidewalk, a minimum charge equal to the City charge in
effect for a unit of 10 square feet of such work;



 



   (3)   For concrete curb, a minimum charge equal to the City charge
in effect for a unit of 3 linear feet of such work; and



 



   (4)   For leakage detection and stake holes, a minimum charge equal
to the City charge in effect for a unit of 4 holes.



 



   bb.   Upon the adoption of a schedule of verified costs by the Board
as provided herein, the Board shall transmit copies of the Board order to the
Mayor and to the City Council. At any time within 30 days after the receipt
of the Board order, the Mayor, by writing, or the Council, by majority vote,
may disapprove the Board order. If neither the Mayor nor the City Council
disapproves the Board order within the 30-day period, the schedule shall
become effective, and the Board shall collect charges according to the new
schedule.



 



   2.   Minimum Charge for Each Type of Resurfacing.  The minimum
charge for each permit to cover the cost of inspection of the restoration of
unimproved areas will only be made when no other type of resurfacing is
included in the permits. If another type of resurfacing is included, the
charge for inspection of the restoration of unimproved areas will be based
upon the actual area excavated times the unit charge for such inspection. The
minimum charges for all other types of resurfacing will be made, when
applicable, whenever any such resurfacing is actually placed regardless of
whether one or more types of resurfacing is involved.



 



   3.   Minimum Charge for a Permit.  On permits issued where no
resurfacing is actually done, a minimum charge of $31.00 will be made.  The
fee herein shall be adjusted, if required, in order to recover the City’s
administrative costs, and adopted in the same manner as provided in Section
12.37 I.1. of the Los Angeles Municipal Code for establishing fees.

SEC. 62.06.  ESTABLISHMENT OF A STREET DAMAGE RESTORATION FEE.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 185,818, Eff. 12/6/18.)



 



   A.   Any person, corporation or agency, including any Department,
Bureau, or Agency of the City of Los Angeles or any other governmental agency
or authority required to obtain a permit to excavate in a public street or
alley under Sections 62.02, 62.04, 62.105 or 64.17 of this Code must pay a
Street Damage Restoration Fee (SDRF) at the time of obtaining the permit,
which shall be deposited into the Street Damage Restoration Fee Special Fund
(Los Angeles Administrative Code Section 5.121.6).  No portion of this
ordinance requires the Bureau of Street Services to obtain permit authority
to accomplish its work, which includes maintenance, construction and
reconstruction activities within a public right-of-way and easement.



 



   1.   The SDRF is set at $8.24 per square foot for Local Streets and
$19.44 per square foot for Select Streets and applies to an area that equals
the length and width of the excavation cut plus 5 feet on all sides of the
excavation.



 



   2.   For purposes of this section, a Select Street shall be a street
designated by the Bureau of Street Services as a street requiring a thicker
pavement design to accommodate greater traffic loads.  A Local Street shall
be a street not designated as a Select Street.  The Bureau of Street
Services shall maintain a public record of its street designations.



 



   3.   The Board of Public Works shall calculate a revised SDRF
annually on July 1, in accordance with the California Department of
Transportation Price Index for Selected Highway Construction Items.  The
proposed revised SDRF shall be effective upon its adoption by resolution
approved by the Board of Public Works following a public hearing.



 



   4.   For any excavation on a concrete street, full slab replacement
is required in lieu of paying the SDRF.



 



   B.   In addition to the SDRF, the Bureau of Engineering shall charge
and collect a fee of $18.50 for the cost of calculating and collecting the
SDRF.



 



   C.   SDRF Exemptions:



 



   1.   Any excavation in a street scheduled for resurfacing under the
City's Annual Street Renewal Plan within the one year prior to the scheduled
resurfacing shall be exempt from the SDRF.



 



   2.   Any entity identified in Paragraph A. of this section may
qualify for an exemption from the SDRF for an excavation made up to 23 months
prior to scheduled resurfacing by doing the following:



 



   (a)   Reviewing the City's Five-Year Street Renewal Plan and
one-year Annual Street Renewal Plan prepared by the Director of the Bureau of
Street Services prior to applying for an excavation permit; and



 



   (b)   Preparing and submitting to the Bureau of Street Services a
five-year street excavation plan and a one-year street excavation plan, in a
form acceptable to the Bureau, prior to applying for an excavation permit. 
Such plans must include the following:



 



   (i)   The location of the entity's existing facilities in any City
street, alley, sidewalk or other public place; and



 



   (ii)   A description of all of the entity's planned excavation work
in any City street, alley, sidewalk or other public place.



 



   3.   Thereafter, in order to continue to qualify for the SDRF
exemption:



 



   (a)   Each entity must submit annually, by April 15 of each year
following the submission of the five-year street excavation plan and one-year
street excavation plan, a revised and updated five-year street excavation
plan and one-year street excavation plan; and



 



   (b)   All excavations in any Local Street or any Select Street must
be shown on the entity's one-year street excavation plan, and must take place
within 23 months prior to City's planned resurfacing or rehabilitation
projects as shown in the City's Five-Year Street Renewal Plan and one-year
Annual Street Renewal Plan.



 



   D.   The SDRF established herein is in addition to any other fee
required by this Code, and is in addition to any special backfill, compaction
and pavement replacement or other requirement imposed by this Code or by the
Department of Public Works as a condition of a permit.



 



   E.   In lieu of paying the SDRF, any entity identified in Paragraph
A. of this section making an excavation in a street within one year following
the resurfacing of the street must repave the entire street block from curb
face to curb face.  Exceptions may be made when it can be sufficiently
demonstrated to the Director of the Bureau of Street Services that the City's
30-day notice of a scheduled street resurfacing project was not mailed to the
correct property owner of record at the time of notification, and the
property owner made significant efforts to promptly notify the Bureau of
Street Services of any planned street excavations.

color that is consistent with existing surrounding earth. Any slough walls
constructed to protect an AGF installation shall be an earth-tone color
consistent with the existing surrounding soil.




 




   H.   Density Threshold: The area between the two adjacent
intersections of two sets of intersecting streets shall be defined as a city
block, including sidewalks on either side of the street. Accordingly, the
maximum number of AGF installations in the public right-of-way per city block
shall be as follows:




 




   1.   For city blocks in which the two adjacent intersections are
less than 1000 feet apart, the threshold is three (3).




 




   2.   For city blocks in which the two adjacent intersections are
equal to or greater than 1000 feet apart, the threshold is three (3), plus a
maximum of one (1) additional AGF for every additional 250 feet of adjacent
intersection separation.




 




   3.   In Parking zones (LAMC 12.12.1) and Industrial zones (LAMC
12.17.5 - 12.20), there is no AGF threshold per city block.




 




   All facilities exempt from the AGFSP shall not be counted in the number
of AGF installations per city block. The Board of Public Works may grant a
variance from the AGF density threshold per city block at its discretion when
the threshold is reached and when measures consistent with the AGFSP mitigate
the excessive number of AGF installations. AGF co-location may be required as
a mitigation measure. The BOE shall prepare a Variance Board Report for
consideration of the applicant s variance request by the Board of Public
Works. The Bureau of Engineering shall process the initial variance request
within 35 days of submission and, in cases where multiple variances are
requested, may take up to five additional days for each additional variance
request. The 35 days deadline shall commence when BOE verities the density
variance request is accurate and complete.

building or structure upon, over, along or across any street. Such
notification shall state the time when and the route over which such
temporary rearrangement of any property of said Public Utility shall occur;

reasonable sum, not exceeding fifteen percent (15%) of such actual cost, as
an allowance for supervision.



 



   (d)   Such Public Utility must within 30 days from and after the
completion of the work of making such temporary rearrangement or restoring of
its property, present an itemized bill of the cost thereof to the housemover

   (e)   In case the cost of the rearrangement, protection and
restoration of said property is less than the amount estimated and deposited,
as provided in Subsection (C) of Section 62.84, then the public utility shall
return to the permittee depositing the same the amount of unused balance of
said deposit, less the damage to said property, if any, caused by the
negligence of the permittee in moving any building or structure or section or
portion thereof. In case the actual cost is more than the amount estimated
then such public utility affected shall collect the actual cost of the work
from the permittee and the permittee shall pay said total cost. In the event
a change of route is necessary, any additional expense shall be borne by the
permittee. (Amended by Ord. No. 131,900, Eff. 4/9/66.)

additional work required and it shall be incumbent upon the permittee to

   All buildings shall be loaded on equipment having rubber-tired wheels.



 



   In the event that the equipment of the house mover is not sufficient
for the work required, or if a street or the use thereof, or the property of
any public utility will be at any time endangered or damaged by such removal,
or if such house mover, or his servants or employees at any time violate any
of the terms, conditions or restrictions of the permit required by Sec.

supervision fee shall not be charged and the special deposit shall be
refunded.



 



   In addition to any other deduction provided for in this section, a
charge per day for each day that such building, or structure, or section or
portion thereof shall have occupied any portion of the street, when the same
is not being actually moved thereon, shall be deducted from the
aforementioned deposit. The remainder of such deposit, if any, shall be
refunded to the person making such deposit, or to his assigns. In case the
deposit made pursuant to Section 62.88 shall be insufficient to pay the cost
of the service inspector and the cost of the repairs, if any, the person
making such deposit shall, upon demand, pay to the Board a sufficient sum to
cover all such costs. Upon failure to pay such sum, it may be recovered by
the City in any court of competent jurisdiction.



 



   The fees and charges herein shall be determined and adopted in the same
manner as provided in Section 12.37I1 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code for

agree to television testing of potentially unsound pipes and indemnification
as provided hereinabove, no permit shall issue.

   (Added by Ord. No. 140,170, Eff. 5/17/70.)



 



   (a)   Declaration of Purpose.  It is the purpose of this section to
provide a just, equitable, and practicable method, to be cumulative with and
in addition to any other remedy available at law, whereby parkways in
commercial or industrial zoned property fronting on major or secondary
highways on which weeds, debris or an accumulation of rubbish exist in such
amounts and to such an extent as to constitute a menace to the safety, health
and general welfare of the people of this City, may be required to be paved.



 



   (b)   Necessary City Council Determinations.  If the City Council
determines that weeds, debris or rubbish exist on parkways in commercial or
industrial zones fronting on major or secondary highways as shown on the
latest revised Master Plan of Highways in such amounts and to such an extent
as to create a menace to the public health, welfare and safety, and to
constitute a public nuisance; and



 



   If the City Council further determines that it is impossible or
impracticable to maintain such parkways free of such weeds, debris or rubbish
by ordering the use of any other methods, the City Council may order the
owners of property fronting on said parkways to pave said parkways with
concrete including tree wells and street trees in accordance with the
provisions of this section.



 



   (c)   Zones – Applicable.  For purposes of this ordinance the
following zones shall be considered commercial or industrial zones: P, PB,
CR, C1, C2, C4, CM, M1, M2, and M3.



 



   (d)   Notification to Pave.  When the Board of Public Works finds
that owners of property located in commercial or industrial zones fronting on
parkways adjacent to primary or secondary highways have failed to maintain
said parkways free of weeds, debris or rubbish, said Board may, upon
instructions of the City Council, notify the owner or person in possession of
the property fronting on the parkway to pave said parkway with concrete.



 



   (e)   Notice – Requirements.



 



   1.   Notice to pave the parkway may be given by delivering a written
notice personally to the owner or other person in possession of the property
facing upon the parkway or by mailing a postal card, postage prepaid, to the
person in possession of such property or to the owner thereof at his last
known address as it appears on the last equalized assessment roll or to the
name and address of the person owning such property as shown in the records
of the office of the City Engineer.  (Amended by Ord. No. 181,595, Eff.
4/10/11.)



 



   2.   The postal card shall contain a notice to pave the parkway and
the Board of Public Works shall immediately upon the mailing of the notice
cause a copy thereof, printed on a card of not less than 8 inches by 10
inches in size, to be posted in a conspicuous place on the property.



 



   3.   The notice shall specify the day, hour and place when the City
Council will hear and pass upon objections and protests, if any, which may be
raised by any property owner or any interested person, but in no case shall
such hearing be sooner than 10 days after giving of notice. Upon the day and
hour fixed for the hearing the City Council shall hear and pass upon such
objections and protests. The decision of the City Council on a protest or
objection which may be made shall be final and conclusive.



 



   4.   The notice shall set forth the street address and a legal
description, sufficient for identification, of the locations at which the
parkways are to be paved. It shall particularly specify what parkways are to
be paved, and that the paving shall be done pursuant to the specifications
set forth in the Municipal Code for sidewalk construction and pursuant to
rules and regulations of the Board of Public Works and upon the issuance of a
permit by the Board of Public Works. The notice shall further specify that if
the construction is not commenced within 60 days after notice is given and
diligently and without interruption prosecuted to completion within a
reasonable time period to be specified in said notice, the Board of Public
Works shall cause the paving to be done and the cost thereof shall be a lien
on the property.



 



   (f)   Failure to Comply With Notice – Board to Perform Work.  If
the construction is not commenced and prosecuted to completion with due
diligence as required by the notice, or by the City Council, the Board of
Public Works shall forthwith cause the parkway to be paved, including
providing for tree wells and street trees where applicable, and failure by
the property owner to pay the costs of the work shall result in a lien
against the property fronting on the parkway as provided below.  (Amended by
Ord. No. 175,596, Eff. 12/7/03.)



 



   Once the Board has commenced the paving work, the owner or person in
possession of the affected property shall be deemed to have forfeited all
rights and privileges to do such work and is thereafter prohibited from doing
such work except as the Board may otherwise allow and if the owner or other
person having charge or control of the affected property then proceeds to
perform the work without a permit, the Board shall charge the person who
caused said work to be performed the sum of $50.00 as partial reimbursement
to the City for those expenses incurred in preparation of the work, including
solicitation of bids, in the event the City contracts to have the work
performed by private contractors.



 



   (g)   Collection of Costs.  All costs incurred pursuant to this
section shall be a personal obligation against the owner of the property
fronting on the parkway, recoverable by the City in an action before any
court of competent jurisdiction.  These costs shall include an amount equal
to 40 percent of the cost to perform the actual work, but not less than the
sum of $100.00, to cover the City’s costs for administering any contract
and supervising the work required.  In addition to this personal obligation
and all other remedies provided by law, the City may collect any judgment,
fee, cost, or charge, including any permit fees, fines, late charges, or
interest, incurred in relation to the provisions of this section as provided
in Los Angeles Administrative Code Sections 7.35.1 through 7.35.8.  (Amended
by Ord. No. 175,596, Eff. 12/7/03.)



 



   (h)   All payments of costs incurred including fees, fines, late
charges and interest and of the partial reimbursement referred to in
Subsection (f) shall be paid to the Board of Public Works and deposited in
the City Treasury to the credit of the proper fund.  (Amended by Ord. No.

   (b)   Responsibility for Maintenance.  The owner of a Lot shall
maintain any Sidewalk, Driveway Approach, Curb Return or Curb on the Lot in
such condition that the Sidewalk, Driveway Approach, Curb Return or Curb will
not endanger any Person or property passing thereon or violate the Americans
with Disabilities Act.



 



   (c)   Notice of Non-Compliance and Order to Repair.  Except as
provided in Subsection (d), if the Board determines that a Sidewalk, Driveway
Approach, Curb Return or Curb is in a condition that endangers a Person or
property passing thereon or violates the Americans with Disabilities Act, the
Board shall notify the owner of the Lot containing the Sidewalk, Driveway
Approach, Curb Return or Curb to repair the Sidewalk, Driveway Approach, Curb
Return or Curb.  Notice to repair shall be given by posting a Notice of
Non-Compliance and Order to Repair in a conspicuous place on the Lot and by
mailing the notice to the owner of the Lot, at the last known address as
indicated on the last equalized assessment rolls.



 



   (1)   Content of Notice of Non-Compliance and Order to Repair.  The
Notice of Non-Compliance and Order to Repair shall: (a) identify the
Sidewalk, Driveway Approach, Curb Return or Curb requiring repair; (b)
contain a description of the required repair; (c) designate the materials to
be used; and (d) specify the deadlines for commencing and completing the
repair and provide that if the repair is not commenced and thereafter
diligently prosecuted to completion, the Board shall be authorized to make
such repair at the Lot owner's expense, and the cost of the repair shall be

mailing the Notice of Non-Compliance and Order to Repair, or such longer time
as the Board may allow, not to exceed 90 days, the owner of the Lot shall
commence the specified repair in the manner and with the materials specified
in the Notice of Non-Compliance and Order to Repair.  All repair work
performed pursuant to a Notice of Non-Compliance and Order to Repair shall be
completed within 60 days of the date of issuance of the Notice, or such
longer time as the Board may allow, not to exceed 120 days.  No owner of a
Lot receiving a Notice of Non-Compliance and Order to Repair shall fail to
commence or complete the repair within the time specified or in the manner
and with the materials specified.



 



   (3)   Failure to Repair.  If the owner of a Lot receiving a Notice
of Non-Compliance and Order to Repair fails to commence or complete the
repair within the time specified, or in the manner and with the materials
specified, the Board shall have the authority to perform, at the Lot owner's
expense, the work required by the Notice of Non-Compliance and Order to
Repair and any other preventative actions such as root pruning or tree
removal to prevent additional damage.



 



   (4)   Determination of Responsibility for Damage.  Whenever the
Board determines that a Person has damaged a Sidewalk, Driveway Approach,
Curb Return or Curb, all costs incurred by the City to repair the damage
shall be a personal obligation of the Person responsible for the damage,
recoverable by the City in an action before any court of competent
jurisdiction.  If the Person responsible is the owner of the Lot, then the
costs incurred pursuant to this section may be recorded as a lien on the
Lot.  The cost of the actual repair and preventative action, such as root
pruning or tree removal to prevent additional damage, shall be recoverable
along with an amount equal to 40 percent of the cost to perform the actual
work, but not less than $100, to cover the City's costs for administering any
contract and supervising the work.  In addition to this personal obligation
or lien and all other remedies provided by law, if the Board determines that
a Sidewalk, Driveway Approach, Curb Return or Curb is damaged to such an
extent as to create a public nuisance, the City may collect any judgment,
fee, cost or charge, including any permit fees, fines, late charges or
interest, incurred in relation to the provisions of this section as provided
in Los Angeles Administrative Code Sections 7.35.1 through 7.35.8.



 



   (5)   Appeal to the Board.  An owner of a Lot disputing a
determination by the Board in a Notice of Non-Compliance and Order to Repair
may appeal the decision to the Board.  Any such appeal must be in writing
and received by the Board within 30 days of the date of mailing the Notice of
Non-Compliance and Order to Repair.  Further action on the Notice of
Non-Compliance and Order to Repair shall be stayed pending the outcome of the
appeal.  The determination by the Board on appeal shall be final.



 



   (d)   Limitations to Issuing Notice of Non-Compliance and Order to
Repair a Damaged Sidewalk.  Except as provided in Subsection (f), a Notice
of Non-Compliance and Order to Repair with respect to a damaged Sidewalk
shall not be issued: (1) prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Sidewalk
Compliance; or (2) during the Sidewalk Repair Warranty Period unless the
repair is required to remedy damage caused by the owner of the Lot or a third
party.



 



   This limitation on the issuance of a Notice of Non-Compliance and Order
to Repair with respect to a damaged Sidewalk shall not apply to any Sidewalk
first constructed after the effective date of this section, or to any
Sidewalk adjacent to a Lot owned by a governmental entity, including, but not
limited to, the Federal Government, the State of California, any political or
administrative subdivision of the Federal Government or State of California,
and any county, city and county, municipal corporation other than the City of
Los Angeles, irrigation district, transit district, school district, or other

   (e)   Sidewalk Repair Warranty Period.  Except as provided herein,
the Sidewalk Repair Warranty Period shall be 20 years for Residential
Property and five years for Commercial and Industrial Property commencing on
the date the Board issues a Certificate of Sidewalk Compliance to the owner
of the Lot.  The Sidewalk Repair Warranty shall be deemed waived by the Lot
owner if the Board grants the owner's request to keep any tree that the City
otherwise would remove to protect the Sidewalk from ongoing or future
damage.  The Sidewalk Repair Warranty Period shall expire in advance of the
warranty period upon any subsequent repair performed by the Board or its
designee.



 



   (f)   Cap on City Cost to Repair a Sidewalk.  Whenever the Board
repairs a Sidewalk, including during the applicable Sidewalk Repair Warranty
Period, the maximum repair cost to be incurred by the City shall be $20,000
per Lot, adjusted annually in accordance with the Consumer Price Index. 
Prior to the commencement of any repair of a Sidewalk, including during the
applicable Sidewalk Repair Warranty Period, if the Board estimates that the
cost of repair exceeds the limit of this subsection, then the Board shall be
authorized to issue a Notice of Non-Compliance and Order to Repair to the
owner of the Lot in accordance with the provisions of Subsection (c) of this
section.  Any Notice of Non-Compliance and Order to Repair issued pursuant
to this subsection shall also include the Board's estimated cost of repair
and a statement that the City will reimburse the owner for the actual costs
of the repair, up to the amount set forth in this subsection, upon the
completion and inspection of the repair required in the Notice of
Non-Compliance and Order to Repair.  If the Board performs any of the work
required by the Notice of Non-Compliance and Order to Repair pursuant to
Subsection (c)(3) of this section, any actual repair cost in excess of the
amount set forth in this subsection shall be recorded as a lien on the Lot.



 



   (g)   Authorization for Sidewalk Repair Incentive Program.  The
Board is authorized to administer a Sidewalk Repair Incentive Program to
reimburse, in part, an owner of a Lot who voluntarily undertakes Sidewalk
repair work subject to available funding allocated by the City Council for
each fiscal year.  Funds for the Sidewalk Repair Incentive Program shall be
held in the Sidewalk and Curb Repair Fund.  The qualifications for
participation in the Sidewalk Repair Incentive Program shall be determined by
the Board.  The Board also shall set the applicable reimbursement rates for
Residential and Commercial and Industrial Property and all other conditions
for reimbursement.  All applicable permit requirements under this Code shall
apply to any Lot owner participating in the Sidewalk Repair Incentive
Program.  Any dispute regarding the eligibility of an owner to participate
in the Sidewalk Repair Incentive Program, the reimbursement rate, or any
condition imposed for reimbursement, shall be appealable to the Board, and
the Board shall resolve the matter.  The determination by the Board on
appeal shall be final.

shall, after such voluntary application, be treated in all respects as a
permit required by law, except that the bond for the faithful performance of
the work, provided for in Section 62.111, may be waived. All fees, and all
deposits, provided for in the following sections must be demanded and
received as in the case of permits required by law, and the City Engineer may
impose such other conditions as may, in his discretion, be required to assure
that the work may be inspected and supervised without cost or expense to the

all respects as provided in Section 62.111, and adequate in amount to comply
therewith, such bond shall for all purposes be deemed a bond posted pursuant
to that section. (Amended by Ord. No. 83,881, Eff. 2/4/41.)



 



   Nothing in this subsection shall be deemed to bind the City to accept
such improvements for public use, however, if for any reason said
improvements are not in a condition satisfactory to the City Engineer at the
time they are offered for acceptance for public use. (Amended by Ord. No.

railroad shall pave that portion of any street used by the tracks thereof
which such person is required by law to pave and keep in repair, or construct
the tracks or the roadbed of such tracks in any other manner than as
prescribed in Section 62.120 to 62.128 inclusive.



 



 



SEC. 62.120.  RAILROADS – MANNER OF ASPHALT PAVING.



 



   Whenever the Council shall order any street, upon or across which there
are any steam, electric, interurban or street railroad tracks, to be paved
with asphalt, vitrified brick, stone block or other permanent pavement, any
person having such tracks thereon, shall construct the roadbed of such tracks
in the following manner:



 



   All ties upon which rails are laid shall be firmly embedded in
hydraulic cement concrete, or if the said person shall so elect, in ballast
composed of broken stone or screened gravel, grouted as hereinafter provided.
In case hydraulic cement concrete is used, it shall be composed, by volume,
of not less than one (1) part Portland cement to three (3) parts sand and six
(6) parts of broken stone or screened gravel. The concrete shall extend at
least six (6) inches below the bottom of the ties with the top of the ties,
but said concrete below the bottom of the pavement base need not extend more
than three (3) inches beyond the ends of the ties. In case ballast is used it
shall be composed of hard durable stone or of screened gravel, free from dust
and dirt, of such sizes and so graded as to permit of thorough grouting. The
ballast shall be at least six (6) inches thick below the bottom of the ties;
and the space between and around the ties shall be filled in with ballast,
level with the top of the ties; but said ballast need not extend more than
three (3) inches beyond the end of the ties. The entire thickness of the
ballast shall be thoroughly grouted with hydraulic cement mortar composed by
volume of not less than one (1) part Portland cement, to three (3) parts
sand; provided, however, that in case of any street ordered to be paved with
asphalt, the Board may, at its discretion, grant such person special
permission to use ballast without grouting, up to the level of the bottom of
the base of such asphalt pavement; except, that in case such permission is
granted, hydraulic or Portland cement concrete of the character herein
provided, shall be laid between the ties and beneath the rails extending not
less than one (1) foot on each side of each rail and not less than four (4)
inches in thickness beneath the rails.



 



 



SEC. 62.121.  RAILROADS – MANNER OF IMPROVING STREETS.



 



   Whenever the Council shall order the street upon or across which there
are any steam, electric, interurban or street railroad tracks, to be paved or
otherwise improved, any person having such tracks thereon, or across the
same, shall pave or otherwise improve that portion of such street required by
law to be paved and kept in repair, by any person having steam, electric,
interurban or street railroad tracks thereon, in the following manner:



 



   The portion of the street between the rails, and for two (2) feet on
each side thereof and between the tracks, if there be more than one, shall be
paved or otherwise improved in a similar manner in all respects; except as
hereinafter provided, to the work so ordered to be performed upon the
contiguous portion of the street, under the same specifications and
superintendence, with the same kinds of material and to the like satisfaction
and acceptance; provided, that upon all streets which may be hereafter paved
with asphalt, that portion of the street for a space of not less than six and
one-half (6 1/2) inches on the gauge side and not less than three and
three-quarter (3 3/4) inches on the outer side of each rail of such tracks
and contiguous thereto, shall be paved with stone blocks; all of said blocks
to be laid evenly and uniformly on edge in cement mortar upon a concrete
foundation and grouted with hydraulic or Portland cement mortar, composed by
volume, of one (1) part of cement to one (1) part sand. Special types of
blocks or special methods of constructing the pavement along the rails, may
be used with the written consent of the Board. Upon all streets which may be
hereafter improved or re-improved with asphalt or similar pavement, the
specifications for which require a binder course, such binder course need not
be constructed between the rails, within two (2) feet of the rails, or
between the tracks, if there be more than one track.



 



   The entire roadbed construction and paving, except as herein otherwise
provided shall be in accordance with the plans and cross sections for
railroad track construction, on file in the office of the City Engineer,
which plans and cross sections are numbered 26.261 and 26.262 and are
designated “Plans and Cross Sections for Street Railroad Track Construction
in the City of Los Angeles,” and are hereby adopted as and for the plans
and cross sections therefor.



 



 



SEC. 62.122.  RAILROADS – TYPE OF RAILS.



 



   No person owning or operating any steam, electric, interurban, or
street railroad, shall use any rails other than grooved girder rails not less
than seven (7) inches in height, of such pattern and dimensions as shall be
approved by the Board, in the track or in the construction of any new track
of such stream, electric, interurban or street railroad, upon, along or
across any street that shall, after the effective date of Ordinance No.
29,121, approved February 3, 1914, be paved or is paved with asphalt,
vitrified brick, stone blocks or other permanent pavement, except on curves
where guard rails are used, or on track crossings, or switches, or upon steel
bridges, or on those portions of streets where the gradient exceeds ten per
centum, or on any street intersection at the lower termination of gradients
exceeding ten per centum.



 



 



SEC. 62.123.  RAILROADS – CHANGE OF RAILS.



 



   No person owning or operating any steam, electric, interurban, or
street railroad, shall use any rails, other than grooved girder rails, not
less than seven (7) inches in height of such pattern and dimensions as shall
be approved by the Board of Transportation Commissioners in replacing the
rails of any tracks that shall be taken up and replaced, with new or other
rails in streets now paved with asphalt, vitrified brick, stone blocks or
other permanent pavement. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to
require the use of such grooved girder rails on curves where guard rails are
used, or on track crossings, or on those portions of streets, where the
gradient exceeds ten (10) per centum, or on any street intersection at the
lower termination of gradients exceeding ten (10) per centum, or on streets
not paved with asphalt, vitrified brick, stone blocks or other permanent
pavement, or upon steel bridges. Nothing herein contained shall be construed
so as to prevent the use of any rails laid in such paved streets at the time
Ordinance No. 29,121, approved February 3, 1914, became effective, until such
rails shall be replaced or shall be required to be replaced by new or other
rails as provided by Sections 62.119 to 62.128 inclusive. (Amended by Ord.
No. 151,833, Eff. 2/10/79, Oper. 2/25/79.)



 



   Rails laid and in use in such paved streets at the time Ordinance No.
29,121, approved February 3, 1914, became effective, may be replaced by rails
of a type other than grooved girder rails, herein required with the written
consent of the Board of Transportation Commissioners, in any case, where such
replacement shall not exceed one hundred fifty (150) feet of single track.
The Board of Transportation Commissioners is hereby authorized and directed
upon application made to said Board of Transportation Commissioners to
examine into and consider the facts and circumstances in each particular
instance. Whenever, in the opinion of the Board of Transportation
Commissioners, based upon traffic conditions on any street, it is
unreasonable, under existing conditions to require the use of such grooved
girder rails, or to require the construction work of any railroad to be done
in the manner provided in Sections 62.119 to 62.121 inclusive, or whenever,
in the opinion of the Board of Transportation Commissioners, based upon
market conditions, it is impossible or impracticable to obtain such grooved
girder rails, the Board of Transportation Commissioners is hereby authorized
and empowered to permit, by order or resolution, the use upon certain
designated streets, of rails other than grooved girder rails, of such pattern
and dimensions as the Board of Transportation Commissioners may prescribe,
and authorize the construction of the roadbed, and the laying of ties, to be
done in such manner as the Board of Transportation Commissioners may
determine and specify; and the Board of Public Works is hereby authorized and
empowered in such instances, by order or resolution, to permit the paving
adjacent to the tracks and other construction work to be done in such manner
as the Board of Public Works may determine and specify. (Amended by Ord. No.
151,833, Eff. 2/10/79, Oper. 2/25/79.)



 



 



SEC. 62.124.  RAILROAD RAILS – EXEMPTIONS.



 



   The provisions of Sections 62.122 and 62.123 shall not be deemed to
require the use of grooved girder rails of the type described therein in the
construction, operation or maintenance of electric street railroad tracks,
upon the streets hereinafter named, or to require the removal of rails, other
than grooved girder rails, laid prior to the adoption of Ordinance No.
29,121, approved February 3, 1914, in, upon or along the following named
streets:

Street to Wilshire Boulevard; Beaudry Avenue from Alpine Street to Sunset
Boulevard; Commonwealth Avenue from Wilshire Boulevard to Fifth Street.



 



   Nothing contained in this section shall be deemed to relieve any person
constructing, operating or maintaining electric street railroad tracks in,
upon or along any said tracks above named, in the event the rails of said
tracks are hereafter removed, or said tracks, or roadbed reconstructed, from
replacing the rails so removed and constructing the roadbed of such electric
street railroad in accordance with the provisions of Sections 62.119 to
62.128 inclusive.

   Whenever the Council shall have, by Ordinance, ordered any street to be
paved or otherwise improved, upon or across which the tracks of any steam,
electric, interurban or street railroad exists, the Board shall, at the time
said Board makes a written contract for and fixes the time for the completion
of work described in such ordinance, by resolution, also fix the time within
which any person having such steam, electric, interurban or street railroad
tracks thereon, shall complete the reconstruction of the tracks and the
roadbed of such tracks, in the manner provided in Sections 62.119 to 62.128
inclusive, and complete the paving in the manner specified in such ordinance,
of the portion of such street, required by law, to be paved and kept in
repair by such person, for the entire length of the street or portion
thereof, used by such tracks and so ordered to be paved. In the case of any
such street so ordered to be otherwise paved or improved, the Board shall fix
a time within which any such person shall, in the manner specified in such
ordinance, complete the paving or other improvement of such portion of such
street, for the entire length of such street or portion thereof used by such
tracks and ordered to be paved or otherwise improved. The Board by such
resolution shall require such person to do the work specified therein, within
the time so fixed. Said resolution shall refer to said ordinance for further
particulars.



 



   Such time shall not be less than the time specified in such contract
for the completion of the work described therein and may be for such longer
period as the Board shall deem proper. The Board shall cause a copy of the
resolution, certified by its secretary, to be forthwith served upon such
person. Service of such copy may be made by delivering personally to the
manager, superintendent or agent of such person in this City. Proof of the
service of such notice shall be made by the affidavit of the person making
the same and the record thereof shall be kept in the office of the Board.
Nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent the Board from
extending the time so fixed by it and specified in said resolution, for good
cause, and prior to the expiration thereof, upon an application in writing
made by such person. Upon the service of the copy of the resolution, as
aforesaid, it shall be the duty of such person to prosecute the work
specified in resolution with due diligence to completion, within the time so
fixed, or within such time as so extended by the Board.



 



 



SEC. 62.126.  RAILROADS – PROCEDURE FOR REPLACING RAILS.



   (Based on Sec. 9, Ord. No. 29,121, Eff. 3/18/14.)



 



   Whenever any person having steam, electric, interurban or street
railroad tracks upon or across any street that has already been paved with
asphalt, vitrified brick, stone blocks, or other permanent pavement, shall
desire to replace the rails of such tracks, or ties, or both, with new rails
or ties, or both, such person shall, before commencing such work, give
written notice to the Board of his intention so to do. Thereupon the Board
shall cause an inspection to be made of the portion of the street where it is
so proposed to do such work or replacement; and if upon such inspection, the
Board shall find that the pavement thereof or the tracks or the roadbed
thereof, where it is proposed to do such work, has not been constructed in
conformity with the provisions of Sections 62.119 to 62.128 inclusive, the
Board shall, by resolution, order said person to reconstruct such tracks and
roadbed and any part thereof, and to repave the said portion of such street
in the same manner as provided in Sections 62.119 to 62.128 inclusive. The
Board shall, in such resolution, fix the time within which the work therein
described shall be done and shall cause a copy of such resolution to be
served upon such person. Such service shall be made, proved and a record
thereof kept, in the same manner provided for the service of the resolution
mentioned in Section 62.125. The time specified in the order may be extended
by the Board, for good cause, upon written application made by such person
prior to the expiration of such time. If the Board shall find, upon such
inspection, that the roadbed where it is proposed to lay such new rails or
ties has been ballasted with broken stone or screened gravel, nothing herein
contained shall be construed to prevent the Board at its discretion, from not
requiring such roadbed to be reconstructed. If the distance for which such
person shall desire to replace such rails, or ties, or both, shall be less
than one hundred and fifty (150) feet, the Board may, at its discretion,
grant a special permit to use such paving material in the work as the Board
may prescribe; and if such permit is granted, all work or paving and
repairing thereunder shall be done under the instruction and to the
satisfaction of the Board.



 



   Any person served with a copy of said resolution, as herein provided,
is hereby required to prosecute the work specified therein diligently to
completion within the time so fixed and stated therein, or within such time
as may be extended by the Board.

reconstruct such portion of the roadbed, track, pavement, or of the said
wearing surface, within such time as the Board shall fix, which time shall be
stated in such resolution. A copy of said resolution shall be served upon
said person in the manner provided for the service of the resolution
mentioned in Section 62.125.



 



   Any person served with a copy of said resolution is hereby required to
do the work of repair, replacement, or reconstruction within the time fixed

   (h)   Insurance Policy to be Posted.  (Former Subsec. (g)
Redesignated as Subsec. (h) by Ord. No. 176,630, Eff. 6/14/05.)  No permit

personal injury or property damage sustained by any person, caused by or
resulting from or which may be claimed to have been caused by or to have
resulted from, the installation or maintenance of any street banner or
appurtenance installed under the permit, or from any failure to install or
maintain any such street banner or appurtenance in the manner required by

dangerous or defective condition or nuisance created thereby or resulting
therefrom.  Furthermore, by the policy, the City, its officers and employees
as named assures, must be insured against any property damage or personal
injury resulting from any such cause.



 



   In addition, the policy shall be so conditioned as to assure the

ground mentioned above.



 



   The limit of liability upon any policy posted or maintained hereunder
shall not be less than $500,000.



 



   (i)   Bond or Cash Deposit.  (Former Subsec. (h) Redesignated as
Subsec. (i) by Ord. No. 176,630, Eff. 6/14/05.)  No permit shall be issued
hereunder unless in addition to the insurance policy herein above required,
the applicant commercial entity installing street banners posts or has on
file with the Board a surety bond or cash deposit so conditioned as to assure
that the City shall be reimbursed for any expense that may be incurred by the
Board in removing any street banner or appurtenance installed pursuant to the
permit, in repairing damage to street lighting equipment resulting from the
banner installation, or in otherwise enforcing any order, rule or relation of
the Board.  Upon the face of each application received, the Board shall
indicate the amount of indemnity required upon each permit requested, which
shall be at the reasonable discretion of the Board.  The amount of the bond
or cash deposit shall not be less than the amount so indicated.  The unused

the City, the Department, its officers and employees, from any liability
resulting from the applicant's use of the public property and shall execute
the necessary agreements satisfactory to the City Attorney.



 



   (j)   Term Bond or Continuing Cash Deposit Acceptable.  A separate
bond or cash deposit may be posted in connection with each particular, but in
lieu thereof, the Board may accept a term bond or a continuing cash deposit
conditioned to cover all permits which may be issued to any one applicant
commercial entity installing street banners during a specified period of not
to exceed one year, provided, however, that when the total aggregate required
indemnity on all permits requested by the applicant commercial street banner
installation company is greater than the limit of liability on the term bond,
or greater than the cash deposit maintained, no additional permits shall be
issued to the applicant commercial street banner installation company until
sufficient additional indemnity to cover the same is furnished.  (Former
Subsec. (i) Redesignated as Subsec. (j) by Ord. No. 176,630, Eff. 6/14/05.)



 



   (k)   Permits – Issuance – Denial.  Provided that any
application for a permit to hang a street banner or banners meets the
eligibility requirements of this ordinance, the Board shall issue, in whole
or in part, a permit authorizing the installation of the requested street
banner or banners, as long as the required fees, bond, insurance policy and
other protection prescribed above have been posted and approved and provided
the installation of such banner or banners will not damage public property,
unreasonably interfere with its proper use, or endanger public safety or
welfare, as determined by the Board of Public Works.  Each street banner
permit application shall be reviewed by staff in consultation with the City
Attorney to determine if the request complies with all the requirements of
this ordinance.  If staff determines that the request is in full compliance
with this ordinance, the permit shall be issued.  If staff determines that
the application is not in compliance with this ordinance, staff shall timely
notify the applicant of the reason or reasons for non-compliance and, if
possible, suggest what could be done to bring the street banner request into
compliance with the ordinance.  If a street banner request is ultimately
denied by the City, staff shall e-mail or fax the basis of the denial to the
applicant.  (Former Subsec. (j) Redesignated as Subsec. (k) and Amended by

announcing a single event shall not exceed 30 days.  A permit may be renewed
or extended for up to two additional 30 day terms. A permit may not be
renewed or extended at any of the 30 day intervals when the City has on file,
at the time of the requested extension, a permit application from a different
entity seeking a permit for the same light poles occupied by the entity
seeking the permit extension.  The entity seeking the permit extension may
request different light poles, if available, in instances where the original
light poles are used by a new permittee.  Under no circumstances shall a
street banner announcing a single event installed pursuant to a permit issued
pursuant to this code remain on the City's light standards for more than 90
days in a 12 month period.

permit may be renewed or extended for one additional 30 day term.  After 90
days, pursuant to an initial permit with two renewals, a second permit
application may be submitted for a term of 30 days to maintain the already
installed street banners.  The second permit may be renewed for up to two
additional 30 day terms. A permit may not be renewed or extended at any of
the 30 day intervals when the City has on file, at the time of the requested
extension, a permit application from a different entity seeking a permit for
the same light poles occupied by the entity seeking the permit extension. 
The entity seeking the permit extension may request different light poles, if
available, in instances where the original light poles are used by a new
permittee. Under no circumstances shall a street banner announcing a series
of events installed pursuant to a permit issued pursuant to this code remain
on the City's light standards for more than 180 days in a 12 month period.



 



   (3)   Non-Event.  The term of each permit shall be specified on the

renewed or extended at any of the 90 day intervals when the City has on file,
at the time of the requested extension, a permit application from a different
entity seeking a permit for the same light poles occupied by the entity
seeking the permit extension.  The entity seeking the permit extension may
request different light poles, if available, in instances where the original
light poles are used by a new permittee.



 



   (m)   Permits - Location of Street Banners Announcing an Event or

or more light poles, the party requesting the permit may place a maximum of
50 street banners in the vicinity of the event venue and must place the
remaining street banners equally in all Council districts.  (Former Subsec.

   (n)   Permits – Revocation.  (Former Subsec. (m) Redesignated as
Subsec. (n) by Ord. No. 176,630, Eff. 6/14/05.)  Permits may be revoked by
the Board in whole or in part on one or more of the following grounds:



 



   1.   The maintenance of any street banner endangers public welfare,
safety or property;



 



   2.   Failure or refusal to observe any provision of this section or
any rule promulgated by the Board pursuant to authority granted by this
section; or



 



   3.   A material misrepresentation in the application.



 



   (o)   Removal of Street Banner.  (Former Subsec. (n) Redesignated
as Subsec. (o) by Ord. No. 176,630, Eff. 6/14/05.)  Upon expiration of any
permit, any street banner covered thereby must be removed by the permittee
within 72 hours of the date of expiration unless a renewal or written
extension is granted by the Board.  Any street banner not so removed may be
removed by the Board without notice to the permittee.  Upon whole or partial
revocation of any permit, all street banners covered thereby must be removed
on the same date of revocation unless a renewal or written extension is
granted by the Board.  Any street banner not so removed shall, upon
reasonable notice to the permittee, be removed by the Board.  Where any
street banner presents an immediate threat of harm to the public health,
welfare or safety, the Board shall summarily cause its removal.



 



   The costs of all Board removals shall be collected by the Board from
the permittee or from his surety.



 



   (p)   Installation and Maintenance of Street Banners.  Every street
banner must be installed and maintained so as to be safe at all times; it
must not include a print size for any text smaller than that adopted by the
Board of Public Works in its rules and regulations; it must not obstruct the
clear view of traffic signals by pedestrians or operators of bicycles, motor
bikes, cars, trucks or any other type of vehicle or mode of transportation;
it must have a minimum clearance of 22 feet over rails used by freight cars,
of 16 feet above roadways.  The Board may prescribe other needed clearance
requirements.  (Former Subsec. (o) Redesignated as Subsec. (p) by Ord. No.
176,630, Eff. 6/14/05.)



 



   (q)   Rules and Regulations.  Consistent with this section, the
Board may adopt rules or regulations to administer the installation,
maintenance and removal of street banners including rules or regulations
pertaining to their location, size, suspension and construction. The Board
may adopt any other rule or regulation for the protection of public safety,
welfare or property. (Former Subsec. (p) Redesignated as Subsec. (q) by Ord.
No. 176,630, Eff. 6/14/05.)



 



   (r)   Commercial Content on Street Banners.  Nothing in the general
prohibition on street banners shall prevent a for-profit entity from
receiving recognition on the street banners announcing an otherwise allowable
Community, Charitable or Non-Profit event, or on permitted non-event street
banners, provided that the recognition of the for-profit sponsorship shall be
limited to the name and or logo of one for-profit sponsoring entity per
street banner and the size of said name or logo shall be limited to less than
20% of the total area of the street banner.  The City of Los Angeles may
defray the cost of City of Los Angeles organized and administered events, and
the cost of non-event street banners by allowing for-profit entities to
co-sponsor City organized and administered events and non-event street
banners, provided that the recognition of the for-profit entity's
co-sponsorship of City events, or non-event street banners is limited to the
same size and content as for allowable Community, Charitable, or Non-Profit
events or permitted non-event street banners.  (Former Subsec. (q)
Redesignated as Subsec. (r) by Ord. No. 176,630, Eff. 6/14/05.)



 



   (s)   The provisions of Article 7, Chapter 6, prohibiting certain
outdoor advertising structures, post signs and advertising statuary adjacent
to freeways, and establishing the procedure for the consideration and
issuance of permits for such structures, signs and statuary, shall also apply
in the same manner and degree to "Street Banner".  (Former Subsec. (r)
Redesignated as Subsec. (s) by Ord. No. 176,630, Eff. 6/14/05.)



 



   (t)   Street Banners – City Ownership after 30 Days.  Up to 3% of
the street banners included in any permit application and hung in the City of
Los Angeles for more than 30 days may become the property of the City of Los
Angeles, if a permittee is notified, at least three days prior to the
expiration of the permit, that the City wishes to take possession of the
street banners once they are removed from the City's poles by the permittee.
If so notified, the permittee shall return the banners to the City once they
are removed from the City's poles.  If the City fails to notify the
permittee at least three days before the expiration of the permit that it
wishes to take possession of the banners, the City shall forfeit its right of
ownership over said banners.  (Former Subsec. (s) Redesignated as Subsec.

   (d)   Applications.  Applications for such permit shall be in
writing upon forms provided by the Board. Each application for a permit to
erect or construct a new canopy shall be accompanied by evidence showing
whether the owners or persons in lawful possession of abutting properties on
the same side of the public street (or streets where the canopy is to be
erected or constructed on a corner) for a distance of 100 feet on each side
of the proposed canopy, and within the same city block, object to or are
agreeable to the erection, construction and maintenance thereof.  (Amended
by Ord. No. 91,257, Eff. 2/7/47.)



 



   (e)   Issuance of Permits.  (Amended by Ord. No. 96,851, Eff.
9/10/50.)  The Board may issue a permit to erect or construct a new canopy
if, in its judgment, the grant of the requested permit would not be contrary
to the public interest and would not result in serious inconvenience to
persons using the public street or sidewalk, or residing in the vicinity, and
if the proposed location of the canopy is an appropriate one.



 



   No permit shall be issued to erect a canopy over the sidewalk at any
location where the construction of such a canopy between the property line
and the entrance to the building on the property is prohibited by the zoning

applicant post or has on file a satisfactory policy of insurance so
conditioned as to insure the City, its officers and employees against any
loss, cost, expense, injury, damage or liability incurred by any reason of
any personal injury or property damage sustained by any person, caused by or
resulting from or which may be claimed or have been caused by or have
resulted from the issuance of any permit under this section, with the
erection, construction or maintenance of any structure or work under such
permit, or from any dangerous or defective condition or nuisance created
thereby or resulting therefrom.  (Amended by Ord. No. 165,630, Eff. 4/23/90.)



 



   (h)   Construction.  All framework and supports including metal
covering, if any, shall have corrosion-resistant surfaces. All sheet metal
screws shall be stainless steel or equivalent. All bolts, nuts, and washers
shall have cadmium plate, galvanized or equivalent corrosion-resistant
surfaces. All metal surfaces shall be properly prepared before the protective
coating is applied. If paint is used, the first coat must be a suitable, top
quality metal primer like that used in current structural practice. The

sidewalk or parkway on a line not less than one foot and not more than two
feet from the face of the curb; provided, however, that when the width of the
sidewalk or parkway is such that in the opinion of the Board, two posts will
not safely and satisfactorily support such canopy, additional vertical posts
shall be installed, pursuant to instructions from the Board. (Amended by Ord.
No. 104,682, Eff. 1/29/55.)



 



   Each canopy shall be constructed in such a manner that no portion
thereof shall extend closer than one foot to the face of the curb. No canopy
shall exceed a height of 12 feet or a width of 10 feet; except, however,
where the entrance to any building or place of business exceeds the width of
10 feet, the Board may authorize a canopy of greater width. The horizontal
framework shall not be less than eight feet above the sidewalk or parkway at
every point. (Amended by Ord. No. 104,682, Eff. 1/29 /55.)

for a 15-lb. wind and a 15-lb. live load by an architect or engineer. Plans
shall be submitted in triplicate with calculations to the City Engineer for
his approval prior to the issuing of a permit. (Amended by Ord. No. 108,894,
Eff. 3/22/57.)



 



   (i)   Design of Coverings.  Each canopy shall be covered with
durable and substantial quality of canvas, cloth, galvanized iron, aluminum,
an approved slow-burning plastic or similar material, and the aesthetic

the building or place of business, and the legal street number thereof.
(Amended by Ord. No. 108,894, Eff. 3/22/57.)



 



   (j)   Inspection.  Prior to the issuance of a permit for the
erection or construction of a new canopy, an inspection shall be made of the
place where the canopy is to be so erected or constructed. Prior to the
renewal of any canopy permit an inspection of the existing canopy shall first
be made. Each permittee shall at all times maintain his canopy in good
condition and repair. (Amended by Ord. No. 91,257, Eff. 2/7/47.)



 



   (k)   Power to Suspend or Revoke.  The Board may revoke or suspend
any permit for the erection and maintenance of any canopy for failure to
comply with the provisions of this section, and it shall be unlawful for any
person whose permit has been suspended or revoked to erect or maintain such
canopy. In event of revocation of a permit, such canopy, including all
framework and supports, shall be entirely removed, and the sidewalk or street
restored to its original condition. Thereafter no permit shall be issued
except in the manner provided for the granting of a new permit. (Amended by
Ord. No. 91,257, Eff. 2/7/47.)



 



   (l)   Regulations.  The Board is authorized to prescribe such other
uniform regulations as to structure, design, specifications for frame work
and construction as it may deem necessary, to which regulations such canopies
shall conform. (Amended by Ord. No. 91,257, Eff. 2/7/47.)



 



   (m)   Plastics - Approval by Board.

be issued; but the Board in its discretion may limit the number of trips,
establish seasonal or other time limitations within which the vehicle or
vehicles described may be operated, or otherwise limit or prescribe
conditions of operation, when necessary to assure against undue damage to

exceed 95,000 pounds gross weight; and



 



   (iii)   The vehicle, in combination with its load, confirms to the
axle weight limits specified in California Vehicle Code Section 35550, or a
successor section, and does not exceed the axle weight limits specified in
California Vehicle Code Section 35551, or a successor section.



 



   (b)   A permit issued pursuant to the provisions of Subsection (a)
of this Section shall not authorize the movement of hazardous material or
hazardous waste, the transportation of which by the permittee in the
permitted vehicle would violate local, state, or federal law.



 



   (c)   The Board shall have the authority to adopt policies, rules,
and regulations to effectuate the purposes of this Section and to implement
and administer its duties imposed pursuant to the provisions of this
Section.  The Board's authority includes, but is not limited to, requiring
applicants to provide proof of insurance pursuant to the provisions of
Section 62.145, requiring applicants to agree to indemnify the City for
damages caused by operation of the permitted vehicle, and requiring persons
issued permits to keep the permit in the permitted vehicle at all times and
furnish the permit upon request to an agent of the Board or to any law
enforcement officer or official.  The Board, to safeguard the public health,
safety, welfare or property, may regulate the movement, size and weight of
the material being transported pursuant to a permit issued under the
provisions of Subsection (a) of this Section, and the Board's regulatory
authority includes, but is not limited to, designating routes that can be
traveled, days and hours that materials can be transported, and required
safety devices.



 



   (d)   The Board or its authorized agent may suspend or revoke a
permit issued pursuant to the provisions of Subsection (a) of this Section
for any of the following reasons:



 



   (1)   The failure of the permittee to abide by any of the
requirements of this Section or of the Board's rules, regulations or
requirements; or



 



   (2)   The failure of the permittee to maintain the required
insurance; or



 



   (3)   Where the Board or an authorized agent of the Board determines
that there is sufficient cause to suspend or revoke a permit because the
continued movement of the vehicle for which the permit was issued would
jeopardize the safety of motorists or would damage the right of way.

   In case any tree, shrub or plant in any street in the city, or standing
on privately owned real property and overhanging or projecting into a public
street, appears to be dead, liable to fall, dangerous, or an obstruction to
public travel on any such street, the Board shall cause the same, or such
parts thereof as are dead, liable to fall, dangerous, or an obstruction to
such public travel, to be cut down, and, if in the street, to be removed
therefrom. Before the Board causes any such tree or shrub to be cut down or
removed, the Board shall give at least ten days written notice of its
intention to so proceed to the owner, occupant, or agent of the property upon
which the tree or shrub is located, or of the property which abuts that part
of the street in which the tree or shrub is located, provided, however, that
where the immediate cutting and removal of the tree is necessary to protect
the public from danger, such notice shall not be required. Such an owner,
occupant, or agent may file with the Board his or her objection to such
cutting and removal. These objections must be filed within seven (7) days
after the Board has given such notice of intent. In the event the objections
are timely filed, the tree or shrub shall not be cut down or removed unless
such owner, occupant, or agent has been given a reasonable opportunity to be
heard in support of his or her objection. The Board’s determination after
the hearing shall be set forth in writing and a copy thereof forwarded to the
party who had filed the objections.

exception shall be in writing and shall be filed with the Board in the manner
it prescribes.

   (Amended by Ord. No. 154,185, Eff. 8/25/80.)



 



   (a)   The Department of Public Works shall require a fee as a
condition of a grading permit involving the import or export of more than one
thousand cubic yards of earth materials to or from a site in the hillside
area. The fee shall be based upon the total number of cubic yards of earth
materials to be imported and the miles of public streets to be traversed
within the hillside area, excepting freeways, by a haul vehicle on one trip
in one direction. To such factors a charge determined by the Board for
transportation of one cubic yard per mile shall be applied, with the minimum
and maximum fee to be established by the Board. The fees and charges herein
shall be adopted in the same manner as provided in Section 12.37 I.1. of the
Los Angeles Municipal Code for establishing fees.  (Amended by Ord. No.
165,675, Eff. 5/11/90.)

condition of a grading permit, that the applicant pay a fee of $500 for the
preparation of a noise and vibration study in the event such study is needed

materials in the manner proposed will endanger the public health, safety or
welfare. Upon payment of said fee and upon request therefor by the
Department, the General Services Department shall prepare such report.

   The Department of Public Works may require a bond as a condition of a
grading permit involving the import or export of more than 100 cubic yards of
earth materials within a hillside area. Any such bond shall be in a form
approved by the City Attorney, executed by the permittee and a corporate
surety authorized to do business in this state in an amount sufficient to
cover the cost of repair of any damage to the public streets and any public
facilities therein and the cost of removal of any earth materials or other
debris deposited therein, reasonably expected to result from the
permittee’s operations. The conditions of the bond shall guarantee payment
to the City for all costs and expense in repairing the damaged streets or
other public facilities and the removal of any deposits of earth materials or
other debris resulting from the permitted operations. In lieu of a surety
bond, the permittee may file a cash bond with the Department upon the same
terms and conditions and in an amount equal to that which would be required
in the surety bond. The deposit submitted may be in the form of cash or
negotiable United States securities. The term of such bond shall begin on the
date of filing and shall remain in effect until the completion of the hauling
operations and subsequent inspection of the affected public streets by the
Department of Public Works.

that the imposed requirements are part of and attached to the permit. The
applicant shall retain a photocopy of the permit with attachments at the
worksite.



 



   (a)   For work within the roadway, which is proposed to be conducted
at night between 7:00 PM and 5:30 AM Monday through Saturday, the applicant
shall normally be required to maintain at least two lanes of traffic on a
one-way street and one lane of traffic in each direction on a two-way street
during those night hours with all lanes open to traffic at all other times,
unless a Temporary Street Closure is approved.  Also, the applicant shall
maintain those traffic control devices and flashing arrow signs, shown and
discussed in the latest editions of the Work Area Traffic Control Handbook
(WATCH manual), the Federal Highway Administration’s Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices, and the State of California Traffic Manual.  In

dimensioned scaled drawings showing the proposed work areas, official street
centerlines, curb lines, adjacent intersections, existing striping, existing
parking controls, existing driveways, and proposed detour traffic controls
for each stage of work.  If approval for work within the proposed day-time
period or with only one lane of traffic is denied by the Review Committee
then the applicant shall seek approval to work at night, as discussed above,
or may appeal the requirement for night work to the Appeals Committee.  If
the Review Committee grants approval for work within the proposed day-time
period, then it shall subject the applicants to a Traffic Management Fee and
assign Worksite Traffic Control Conditions to be incorporated in the
appropriate permit issued by the Department of Public Works.  These
conditions shall include traffic management strategies within the public
right-of-way such as: general traffic control requirements; traffic control
devices required to be used; traffic lane requirements and lane closures;
hours approved for construction; detours, which shall be implemented by the

approved Worksite Traffic Control Plan submitted by the applicant to the
Department of Transportation for approval.



 



   (c)   A Worksite Traffic Control Plan may be required where street
work necessitates that motorists travel in paths for several days that
conflict with permanent striping.  The Worksite Traffic Control Plan and
Traffic Circulation Plan, if required, shall be prepared under the direction
of a Traffic Engineer or a Civil Engineer experienced in the preparation of
Traffic Control Plans and registered in the State of California, and shall
have the signed approval of the Division Engineer in Charge of the Design
Division, Department of Transportation, prior to the issuance by the
Department of Public Works of the appropriate permit.  Each copy, including
the permittee required copies, shall be signed and stamped by the registered
engineer.  Two copies shall be retained by the Department of Transportation
and three copies by the Bureau of Engineering.  An Approved Worksite Traffic
Control Plan and/or Traffic Circulation Plan may be required when the

emergency.



 



   5.   Encroachment.  Encroachment is any use, occupation or
activity, which requires the closure of any portion of the Street.



 



   6.   Public Way Reservation System (PWRS).  The PWRS is an internet
based geographic information system, which displays (geo-codes) proposed work
or activity within an arterial street or highway and identifies the entity
performing or permitting the work along with the scope and scheduled time.



 



   7.   Public Way Reservation System Applicant (PWRS Applicant). 
PWRS Applicant(s) is any agency, entity or permit applicant which is
attempting to reserve space for their proposed construction.



 



   8.   Street(s).  Street(s) is any arterial street classified as any
Major Highway, Secondary Highway or Collector Street, as identified by the
Master Plan, which includes any portion of the street, sidewalk or parkway.



 



   9.   Public Way Reservation System Management Committee (PWRSMC). 
The PWRSMC is a group or committee that may be formed and that has a
chairperson.  The City Engineer or his representative shall be the
chairperson of the Committee.



 



   C.   Public Way Reservation.  All entities that intend to encroach
are required to reserve space within the Street and coordinate that activity
or work, using the PWRS.  Coordination shall include joint discussion with
other PWRS Applicants as required to mitigate and minimize traffic
interference.  All reservations shall require a contact name and telephone
number that other PWRS Applicants can call to resolve conflicts in scheduling
reservations.  This contact person shall have the knowledge and authority to
resolve the conflict on the PWRS Applicant's behalf.



 



   1.   City Agencies Performing Work Within the Street.  All City
agencies that perform work within the Street are required to reserve space
and coordinate their work through the PWRS.  Before entering the Street,
each agency shall update its reservation with any changes in scope, location
or schedule.  Each City department or agency performing work or activities
within the Street, which work does not require a permit from the Department
of Public Works, shall designate a PWRS Coordinator for authorizing that
Department's reservations.  All reservations shall be reviewed and
authorized by the Department's PWRS Officer or designated representative in
advance of performing the work.  The authorization shall certify that the
work has been coordinated with all other reservations in the vicinity and
that traffic interference has been minimized.



 



   2.   City Agencies Issuing Permits Within the Street.  All City
Agencies that process permits for work or activities within the Street shall
verify that each permit applicant has reserved the appropriate location using
the PWRS, and has coordinated the work with all other activities in the
vicinity.  If the applicant has a reservation, and all other permit
requirements are complied with, the City agency shall process the permit. 
If the applicant has no PWRS reservation, the permit shall be denied. 
Issuance of a permit shall constitute verification of the reservation by the
issuing agency.



 



   3.   Requirements for Non-City Agencies Performing Work Within the
Street Requiring a Permit from the Board of Public Works.  An applicant for
a permit to perform work within the Street shall first verify with PWRS that
no conflicts exist for the location and time of their activity.  If no
scheduling conflict exists, the permit applicant may continue with the permit
issuance procedure.  The appropriate City agency shall submit the
reservation in PWRS.  If a conflict exists, the permit applicant must
coordinate the work activities prior to permit issuance.  In certain cases,
the non-City agency may be granted authorization to enter reservations in
PWRS.  These agencies will be determined by the PWRSMC.



 



   4.   Requirements for Non-City Agencies Performing Work Within the
Street Not Requiring a Permit from the Board of Public Works.  All non-City
agencies that perform work within the Street shall use the PWRS as a tool to
coordinate the request for work prior to obtaining required approvals through
the appropriate City agency.  If no conflict exists, the non-City agency
shall relate this information to the appropriate City agency prior to
receiving approvals.  If a conflict exists, the non-City agency must
coordinate the work activities prior to receiving approvals for work.  In
certain cases, non-City agencies may be granted authorization to enter
reservations in PWRS.  In this case, the reservation must be submitted prior
to receiving approvals from the appropriate City agency.



 



   D.   Dispute Resolution.  If a dispute arises amongst PWRS
Applicants when coordinating conflicts, the Bureau of Engineering Central
District Engineer may be requested to mediate the dispute.  Decisions made
by the District Engineer may be appealed to the PWRSMC.  The committee will
then make a determination on which activity or work will take precedence. 
The PWRSMC shall establish rules, guidelines and procedures for the use of
PWRS and the appeal process.



 



   E.   Exemptions.  The following work or activity shall be exempt
from the reservation requirements of this article:



 



   1.   Emergency Work as defined in Subsection B. of this section. 
For Emergency Work requiring a permit, a permit must be obtained within one
business day of the commencement of the Work.



 



   2.   Maintenance Work or Activity that will take no more than four
hours.



 



   3.   Any Work or Activity within a Street classified as a Local
Street.



 



   4.   Transportation related activities currently regulated by LAPD
and LADOT such as delivery of freight.



 



   F.   Fees.  PWRS reservations will not require additional fees. 
Permit fees shall remain the same as currently authorized by the City
Council.  The PWRSMC shall evaluate the need for additional fees at the end
of the 12-month period and present its findings to the Board of Public Works
and the City Council.

   The Board of Playground and Recreation Commissioners, in the exercise
of sound and reasonable discretion based upon compliance with the provisions
of this article and based upon the effect the proposed or existing structure
may have or has had upon any of the rights or interests of the public, and of
its effect on the public beach land, may grant or deny any and all
applications to construct, maintain, repair or operate any of the structures
mentioned in Section 63.08 for which an application has been made; provided,
however, that the Board of Playground and Recreation Commissioners must grant
or deny any application within sixty days after the date of the filing of the
same.



 



 



SEC. 63.15.  REVOCATION OF GRANTS.



 



   The Board of Playground and Recreation Commissioners shall have the
power to suspend or revoke any grant issued under the provisions of this
article, and during the suspension of any such grant, or after the revocation
of the same, no person whose grant is suspended or revoked shall erect,
construct, maintain or use any structure mentioned in the revoked or
suspended grant.



 



   The Board of Playground and Recreation Commissioners may, when a grant
is revoked, or if the structure is maintained without a grant, order or cause
the structure to be destroyed.



 



   The Board of Playground and Recreation Commissioners shall follow the
procedure outlined in Section 22.02 of this Code in revoking or suspending
such grant. The said Board shall only have the right to revoke or suspend a
grant when the holder thereof violates any of the provisions of this Code or
the terms and conditions of the grant.



 



 



SEC. 63.16.  GRANTS – MAY IMPOSE CONDITIONS.



 



   The Board of Playground and Recreation Commissioners in the issuance of
any grant may impose therein any and all reasonable terms and conditions that
the Board may in its discretion determine to be necessary for the
preservation of public beaches, public beach lands and the waterfront areas
of the City.



 



 



SEC. 63.17.  BOARD MAY DENY GRANTS.



 



   In case the Board of Playground and Recreation Commissioners deny any
application for a grant under Section 63.08 within thirty (30) days after
written notice to the applicant of the denial of the application, any
applicant claiming that the action of the Board of Playground and Recreation
Commissioners is arbitrary or unreasonable, may appeal from the decision of
the Board to the City Council. The City Council shall consider said
application and the facts or the circumstances surrounding the same, and the
reason for denial of the grant and, if the City Council shall in its
discretion determine that the action of said Board is unreasonable and
arbitrary, the City Council may issue such grant on the terms and conditions
to be prescribed by the Council, provided such terms and conditions do not
violate any State law or Charter provisions concerning beach lands, tide
lands or waterfront property, and provided further that such terms and
conditions prescribed by the Council do not violate the provisions of this
article relating thereto.



 



 



SEC. 63.18.  RENEWAL OF GRANTS – EXISTING STRUCTURES.



 



   If any person now owns or maintains any structure on any public beach
land or water over which the Board of Playground and Recreation Commissioners
now has or may hereafter acquire jurisdiction and said structure has been
erected under and pursuant to a grant issued by the State of California, the
County of Los Angeles, or any municipality now existing, or formerly existing
within the County of Los Angeles, the same may be maintained in its present
condition until the expiration of the time specified in the grant. After the
grant under which any such structure was erected has expired, a renewal of
such grant must be secured from the Board of Playground and Recreation
Commissioners in the manner outlined in this article and subject to the terms
outlined therein. Any existing structure, built under a grant issued by the
State of California, County of Los Angeles, or any municipality now existing
or formerly existing in the County of Los Angeles, on lands that are now
under the control of, or that may hereafter be under the control of the
Playground and Recreation Commissioners of the City of Los Angeles, and which
grant does not specify the length of time for which said grant was to run,
shall expire twenty (20) years from the date of the issuance of the grant.



 



   However, any existing structure hereinbefore mentioned in this section
may be repaired and maintained in the manner specified in the original grant
without the necessity of obtaining a new grant from the Board of Playground
and Recreation Commissioners until the expiration of the life of the grant,
as above mentioned, but such structure cannot be maintained or repaired in a
manner that differs from the manner specified in the original grant for the
construction of the same, and, if any such existing structure is now being
maintained, or has been repaired, or the grantees or their successors
hereafter attempt to maintain or repair such structure in a manner that
differs from the original grant in any way that will affect or change the
drift of sand, or alter the current of water, the owners of such existing
structure must obtain a grant from the Board of Playground and Recreation
Commissioners to maintain such existing structure in its present condition
and a grant must be obtained in the event that any attempt is made to repair
such existing structure in a manner that will alter the current of water or
change the drift of sand in a manner different from the original drift of
sand or flow of current. The Board may deny said application if in the
exercise of a reasonable discretion the Board of Playground and Recreation
Commissioners determines after an investigation, that the particular
structure for which an application is being made has been repaired and is now
being maintained or it is sought to repair or maintain a structure in a
manner different from the construction of the same in its original grant and
the present or contemplated condition of the structure is or would be such
that it would change the current of the water or the drift of the sand in a
manner different from the manner in which the original structure would affect
the current or drift.

work or structure, which may result in the artificial accretion of land to
the adjoining uplands, the Department of Playground and Recreation will
require the applicant for such permit to waive all claims, title and interest
to and in all such artificial accretions of land which may develop as a
result thereof lying beyond or seaward from the line of mean high tide as
shown by the survey accompanying the application and as defined by this

repair will change the drift or alter the current of the water in a manner
different from the effect of such structure to be repaired on the current or
drift prior to the arising of the condition necessitating such repair.

   Nothing in this article contained shall prevent the City Council from
granting to the Board of Harbor Commissioners any tidelands and submerged
lands herein mentioned when the City Council shall determine that the needs
and requirements of commerce, navigation and fishery demand that such
territory be placed under the control, supervision and management of the
Harbor Department.



 



 



SEC. 63.25.  BUILDING PERMITS REQUIRED.



 



   Nothing in this article from Section 63.01 to Section 63.24 shall be
construed in any manner to affect the necessity for an applicant desiring to
erect any structure mentioned in said sections from complying with the
provisions of Ordinance No. 28,700 or Article 1, Chapter 9 of this Code,
except that applicants for grants to construct any structure under such
provisions shall first apply for and obtain the grant mentioned in Section

obligations assumed by the County in the Agreement. Provided, however, that
any such name and product identification shall not directly solicit the sale,
use or consumption of any product; that the County shall not permit name and
product identification of alcoholic beverage or tobacco products; and that
the County shall not display the name of any marketing program sponsor or
donor, or of their products on the beaches in any manner other than as is

intended purposes and can create a public health or safety hazard that
adversely affects the Park and those who use the Park for recreational
activities.  The purpose of this section is to maintain Parks in clean,
sanitary and accessible condition, to prevent harm to the health or safety of
the public, to prevent the misappropriation of Parks for personal use, and to
promote the public health and safety by ensuring that Parks remain readily
accessible for their intended recreational uses.

Parks in clean, sanitary and accessible condition, to prevent harm to the
health or safety of the public, to prevent the misappropriation of Beach
Parks for personal use, and to promote the public health and safety by
ensuring that Beach Parks remain readily accessible for their intended
recreational uses.

and may also be designed to be powered by human propulsion.  For purposes of
this section, a motorcycle (as defined in Vehicle Code Section 400), a
motor-driven cycle (as defined in Vehicle Code Section 405), or a motorized
bicycle or moped (as defined in Vehicle Code Section 406) is not a motorized
scooter.  A device meeting the above definition that is powered by a source
other than electrical power is also a motorized scooter.



 



   2.   No person shall operate an "electric personal assistive
mobility device" or "EPAMD" unless specifically exempt under Subdivisions

operational requirements set forth in California Vehicle Code Sections 21281
and 21281.5.  An electric personal assistive mobility device or EPAMD, as
defined in California Vehicle Code Section 313, shall mean a self-balancing,
non-tandem two-wheeled device that is not greater than 20 inches deep and 25
inches wide and can turn in place, designed to transport only one person,
with an electric propulsion system averaging less than 750 watts (1
horsepower), the maximum speed of which, when powered solely by a propulsion
system on a paved level surface, is no more than 12.5 miles per hour.

scooter-type device" or a "hybrid, multiple-wheeled electric personal
assistive mobility-type device" unless specifically exempt in Subdivisions
4.(a) or (b) of this Section.  For purposes of this section, a hybrid,
multiple-wheeled motorized scooter-type device shall mean a device that has
three or more wheels, has handlebars, has a floorboard that is designed to be
stood upon when riding, or a driver seat that does not interfere with the
ability of the rider to stand and ride, and is powered by an electric motor,
and may also be designed to be powered by human propulsion.  For purposes of
this section, a hybrid, multiple-wheeled electric personal assistive
mobility-type device shall mean a self-balancing, non-tandem, device
containing three or more wheels that can turn in place, designed to transport
only one person.



 



   4.   Exemptions:

personal assistive mobility-type device;



 



   (b)   A person who, by reason of physical disability, is otherwise
unable to move about as a pedestrian pursuant to California Vehicle Code
Section 467(b) may operate a self-propelled wheelchair, a motorized tricycle
or a motorized quadricycle.  A person who, by reason of physical disability,
is otherwise unable to move about as a pedestrian may also operate an EPAMD
or other power-driven mobility device, such as a hybrid, multiple-wheeled
electric personal assistive mobility-type device, subject to the following
safety and operational requirements set forth in California Vehicle Code
Sections 21281 and 21281.5:



 



   1.   The EPAMD or hybrid, multiple-wheeled electric personal
assistive mobility-type device shall not operate on any boardwalk, sidewalk,
bike path or other public way at a speed greater than is reasonable and
prudent having due regard for weather, visibility, pedestrians, and other
conveyance traffic on, and the surface, width, and condition of the
boardwalk, sidewalk, bike path or public way.



 



   2.   The EPAMD or hybrid, multiple-wheeled electric personal
assistive mobility-type device shall not be operated at a speed that
endangers the safety of persons or property.



 



   3.   The EPAMD or hybrid, multiple-wheeled electric personal
assistive mobility-type device shall not be operated on any boardwalk,
sidewalk, bike path or public way with willful or wanton disregard for the
safety of persons or property.



 



   4.   The EPAMD or hybrid, multiple-wheeled electric personal
assistive mobility-type device shall yield the right-of-way to all
pedestrians on foot, including persons with disabilities using assistive
devices and service animals that are close enough to constitute a hazard.



 



   5.   The EPAMD or hybrid, multiple-wheeled electric personal
assistive mobility-type device shall be equipped with front, rear and side
reflectors.



 



   6.   The EPAMD or hybrid, multiple-wheeled electric personal
assistive mobility-type device shall be equipped with a system that enables
the operator to bring the device to a controlled stop.



 



   7.   If the EPAMD or hybrid, multiple-wheeled electric personal
assistive mobility-type device is operated between one-half hour after sunset
and one-half hour before sunrise, a lamp emitting a white light that while
the EPAMD or hybrid, multiple-wheeled electric personal assistive
mobility-type device is in motion, illuminates the area in front of the
operator and is visible from a distance of 300 feet in front of the device.



 



   8.   The EPAMD or hybrid, multiple-wheeled electric personal
assistive mobility-type device shall be equipped with a sound emitting device
that can be activated from time to time by the operator, as appropriate, to
alert nearby persons.



 



   (c)   Violations.  Any Person violating a provision of this section
shall be subject to the following penalties:



 



   1.   First violation.  A first violation of this section shall be
an infraction punishable by a fine in the amount of $100.



 



   2.   Second and subsequent violations.  A second violation and all
subsequent violations shall be subject to the provisions of Section 11.00 of
the Los Angeles Municipal Code, including prosecution as an infraction
punishable by a fine in the amount of $250, or prosecution as a misdemeanor
punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 or by imprisonment in the County
Jail for a period of not more than six months, or by both a fine and
imprisonment.



 



   3.   Violations.  The following constitutes a violation for
purposes of this Section: a conviction for violation of this Section, a
conviction under Penal Code Section 853.7 for failure to appear in court to
contest a citation for violations of this Section, or a forfeiture of bail.



 



   (d)   Severability.  If any subsection, sentence, clause or phrase
of this section is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by a
court of competent jurisdiction, such decision shall not affect the validity
of the remaining portions of this ordinance.  The City Council hereby
declares that it would have adopted this section, and each and every
subsection, sentence, clause and phrase thereof not declared invalid or
unconstitutional, without regard to whether any portion of the ordinance
would be subsequently declared invalid or unconstitutional.

SEC. 64.11.1.  HOUSE CONNECTION SEWER.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 179,073, Eff. 9/23/07.)



 



   Not more than one lot shall be connected to any one house connection
sewer except as provided below.



 



   Exception 1:  On a case by case review, the City Engineer shall have
the authority and discretion to grant an exception to the above requirement
where a single house connection to the City's sewer serves multiple
structures on an individual lot or parcel and that lot or parcel is being or
has been split.  In granting an exception the City Engineer may allow the
continued use of the original house connection to the sewer for the
structures that now exist on more than one lot due to the lot or parcel
split, provided that all the following conditions are met:



 



   a.   There are four or fewer structures connected to the City's
sewer by the single house connection.



 



   b.   The structures on the split lot cannot be reasonably connected
to an existing available sewer due to the physical limitations of either the
lot or the existing available sewer.



 



   c.   There is not physical space available or agreement from the
downstream property owner(s) to place one or more additional house
connections from the upstream split lots or parcels in an easement on the
downstream portions of the original lot or parcel to allow for individual
connections to the City's sewer.



 



   d.   The existing house connection sewer has been inspected by
closed circuit television (CCTV) and if any damage to the existing shared
house connection was revealed by this inspection, that damage has been
repaired to the satisfaction of the Bureau of Sanitation Wastewater
Collection Systems Division.



 



   e.   All property owners using this shared house connection sewer
sign and record reciprocal agreements with the County Recorder providing that
all properties using the shared house connection sewer are mutually
responsible for its full maintenance and repair and that the City shall be
held harmless for its approval to allow multiple lots or parcels to be
connected to the City's sewer via a single house connection.



 



   Exception 2:  On a case by case review, the City Engineer shall have
the authority and discretion to grant an exception to the above requirement
in the case of a new Small Lot Subdivision as defined in Sections 12.03,
12.09, 12.12.1, 12.21 and 12.22 of this Code.  The City Engineer may allow a
new individual house connection sewer to serve more than one lot or parcel
subject to the following conditions:



 



   a.   The size of the new shared house connection sewer for the Small
Lot Subdivision shall be determined by the Bureau of Engineering and be
included in the approved conditions for the subdivision.



 



   b.   A sewer maintenance hole shall be required on the mainline
sewer in the street adjacent to the small lot subdivision property, if the
size of the house connection will not permit a standard "wye" connection to
the City's main line sewer.



 



   c.   A Homeowners Association Agreement or Maintenance Agreement for
all subdivided lots or parcels in the Small Lot Subdivision that are
connected to the shared sewer house connection shall be created and run with
each lot or parcel in perpetuity.  This Agreement shall:  include common
shared maintenance responsibility for the shared house connection sewer among
all lots or parcels served by the shared sewer house connection; bind all the
property owners and successors in interest of the subject lots or parcels to
the agreement; indemnify and hold harmless the City of Los Angeles for
granting the owners of the multiple lots or parcels the right to construct
and/or connect to the shared house connection sewer; and the Agreement shall
be filed with the Los Angeles County Recorder and be binding on all lots or
parcels connected to the shared house connection sewer.



 



   Notwithstanding the above, the City Engineer shall maintain the
exclusive authority and discretion to deny a request of any applicant for a
shared sewer connection, even if the applicant has met all of the above
requirements for either Exception 1 or 2, if the City Engineer believes it is
in the best interest of the City to do so.  If an applicant meets all of the
required criteria for a shared house connection and the City Engineer denies
the request in the best interest of the City, that decision may be appealed
to the Board of Public Works.  The finding of the Board shall be final.



 



 



SEC. 64.11.2.  SEWAGE FACILITIES CHARGE FOR NEW TRACTS.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 140,551, Eff. 6/17/70.)



 



   (a)   Whenever real property tributory to the city sewerage system
that can be served by existing sewers, or by the construction of an off-site
sewer not longer than one mile to an available assured outlet sewer, whether
financed or otherwise, is included within the borders of a new tract map,
sewers, if not existing, shall be constructed within or adjacent to the
tracts to serve each lot, and as a condition of the approval of the tentative
map of each tract and prior to recording of each such tract map, a fee which
shall be determined by the Board of Public Works based upon the rates
established in section 64.11.3, hereafter referred to as the sewerage
facilities charge, shall be paid by the owner thereof to the City, unless the
Board of Public Works upon recommendation of the City Engineer, determines
that it would be contrary to the public welfare and interest to assume the
responsibility of providing the necessary off-site outlet sewers as required
by Subsection (f) hereof. Where a tract map for an industrial, commercial, or
multiple dwelling tract is to be recorded but the tract is to be developed at
some future time, the Board shall charge a fee of $4,127 per acre which shall
be adjusted in accordance with the rates in Section 64.11.3 when such tract
is developed.  (Fee Amended by Ord. No. 171,036, Eff. 6/6/96.)  Provided,
however, that where it is determined by the Board of Public Works that a
particular tract or parcel of land is being subdivided or re-subdivided
solely for the purpose of absorbing a vacated street, for reverting an
earlier tract to acreage, or for converting an existing multiple dwelling to
a condominium, and not for development purposes, that tract or parcel of land
shall be exempt from the requirements that a sewerage facilities charge be
paid therefor.  (Amended by Ord. No. 165,923, Eff. 7/1/90.)



 



   Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the payment of
the sewerage facilities charge as a condition for the filing of a tract map
by the Community Redevelopment Agency or the Department of Airports is hereby
waived. Provided, however, the full sewerage facilities charge shall be paid
upon the development of any lot or parcel contained in a tract to which this
paragraph is applicable.  (Added by Ord. No. 166,072, Eff. 8/25/90.)



 



   (b)   In determining the sewerage facilities charge, the Board shall:



 



   1.   Reduce the sewerage facilities charge when the owner
demonstrates that the property has paid special assessments for an
interceptor sewer to which it may connect directly or indirectly, by the
amount of said special assessment.



 



   2.   Reduce the charge by all or part of the amount paid as a
contributing property to the construction of an off-site sewer to serve the
property prior to the requirement by the City that such charge shall be paid.



 



   3.   Provide a credit for any amount previously paid as an acreage
charge or a sewerage facilities charge.



 



   4.   Reduce the acreage fee to 15% of that established in Subsection
(a) above in the event the sewage from such tract, when developed, will be
treated in the facilities of a Los Angeles County Sanitation District. (Added
by Ord. No. 157,145, Eff. 11/22/82.)



 



   (c)   The Board may permit a subdivider to install off-site sewers
in lieu of all or part of the sewerage facilities charge based on the actual
cost of said off-site sewer. Should the actual cost of said off-site sewer be
less than the sewerage facilities charge required by Subsection (a) hereof,
the difference between such actual cost and said sewerage facilities charge
shall be paid by the subdivider to the City for deposit in the General Fund.



 



   (d)   The Council may authorize the subdivider or other property
owner, by contract with the City, to construct off-site sewers costing in
excess of the sewerage facilities charge required by Subsection (a) hereof
and subsequent to the construction and acceptance of said off-site sewer, to
reimburse said subdivider or property owner the difference between the actual
cost of said off-site sewer and the sewerage facilities charge.



 



   If the sewerage facilities charge has been paid by the subdivider or
property owner prior to entering into the contract with the City to construct
an off-site sewer or prior to submission by the owner of evidence justifying
reduction of the charge for any property in accordance with this section, the
Council may authorize the refund of all or part of the sewerage facilities
charge previously paid.



 



   (e)   Actual cost of off-site sewers as used in Subsections (c) and
(d) shall be determined from sealed bids received and opened by the Board of
Public Works, after publicly advertising therefor, plus engineering and
incidental costs not to exceed ten percent of the accepted bid price for the
performance of the work.



 



   (f)   In those cases where a sewerage facilities charge is paid, the
City assumes the responsibility of providing the necessary off-site or outlet
sewers when sewage disposal facilities are available and when connection to
the City sewerage system is deemed to be necessary by the City.



 



   (g)   Whenever good planning and engineering practice requires that
sanitary sewers of greater size or depth than those required for the
servicing of the property immediately concerned be constructed within or
adjacent to the subdivision, the additional cost of providing sewers within
or adjacent to the subdivision in accordance with the City’s requirements
of larger size or greater depth than that required by the property
immediately concerned shall be considered the same as or in addition to the
cost of constructing an off-site sewer as provided in Subsections (c) and (d)
hereof.



 



   (h)   Subdivisions other than those included in Subsection (a)
hereof may be:



 



   1.   Approved without the construction of sewers or the payment of
the sewerage facilities charge where the County Health Officer and the City
Engineer determined that ample area is available for private sewage disposal,
where soil, ground water and other factors are favorable. The sewerage
facilities charge shall be applicable to lots and parcels in these
subdivisions where connections to future sewers are requested or required.



 



   2.   Permitted or required to construct sewers within the tract and
pay the sewerage facilities charge upon the determination by the Council upon
the advice of the Board, that existing development or trends justify the City
assuming the responsibility of providing the connecting sewers.



 



 



SEC. 64.11.3.  BASIS FOR SEWERAGE FACILITIES CHARGE.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 164,895, Eff. 6/26/89.)



 



   (a)   (Amended by Ord. No. 171,036, Eff. 6/6/96.)  There is hereby
imposed a sewerage facilities charge which shall be a fee for access to the
City’s sewage system based upon a share of the equity of the system.  The
system equity shall include:



 



   (i)   the reproduction cost less depreciation value of the existing
facilities; plus



 



   (ii)   the applicable portion of sewage system reserve funds; less



 



   (iii)   the outstanding debt of the sewage system.



 



   The share of system equity included in the SFC shall be proportional to
the flow, biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids (SS) of the
wastewater discharged into the sewage system from the premises as compared
with the total flow, BOD and SS discharged by all system customers.



 



   (b)   The sewerage facilities charge rates shall be $344.00 per 100
gallons per day average flow, $159.00 per pound per day of BOD and $147.00
per pound per day of SS from the premises.  These rates shall apply for all
sewerage facilities charges and credits imposed pursuant to Section 64.16.1
of this Code.  Any sewerage facilities charge paid on an installment basis
shall be based on the charge rates in effect when the applicant entered into
the installment payment agreement with the City.  (First Sentence Amended by
Ord. No. 182,076, Eff. 4/6/12.)

(Table removed by Ord. No. 170,393, Eff. 3/27/95.)




 



   (c)   In the event the premises are to be connected to the City
sewer system but the sewage entering such system is treated in the facilities
of a Los Angeles County Sanitation District, the sewerage facilities charge
shall be 15% of the rates established in Subsections (b), (d), and (f) of
this section.  (Amended by Ord. No. 165,923, Eff. 7/1/90.)



 



   (d)   The City Engineer with approval of the Board shall set the
sewage generation factors for various occupancies and for mixed occupancies
for the purpose of determining the sewerage facilities charge for new or
remodelled construction, or change in use.  The operative date of this
amended subsection shall be July 1, 1994.  (Amended by Ord. No. 170,393,
Eff. 3/27/95.)



 



   (e)   The Board may require the owner of any property to submit
plans, and such other information as it may need to determine the applicable
sewerage facilities charge. (Added by Ord. No. 164,895, Eff. 6/26/89.)



 



   (f)   For industrial occupancies, the Board shall determine the
average wastewater flow for calculation of the appropriate sewerage
facilities charge through consideration of metered water delivery data, if
available.  If not available, it shall consider the peak flow which the
occupancy is capable of discharging and the occupancy’s expected operating
schedules and practices.  It may establish a minimum reasonable operating
schedule for use in calculating a minimum applicable sewerage facilities
charge.  (Amended by Ord. No. 166,980, Eff. 7/6/91.)



 



   (g)   (Former Subsec. (e), Relettered by Ord. No. 164,895, Eff.
6/26/89.)  The rates fixed by the provisions of this section shall be
implemented as follows:



 



   1.   All sewerage facilities charges paid on or after the operative
date of any amendments to this section shall be at the rates specified
therein.



 



   2.   (Amended by Ord. No. 170,393, Eff. 3/27/95.)  The date for
calculating the applicable sewerage facilities charge for a particular
project or discharge shall be fixed as follows:



 



   (i)   where a sewer connection permit is required, on the date the
connection permit is issued;



 



   (ii)   where no connection permit is required but a building permit
is required, on the date the building permit authorizing the majority of the
structural construction is issued; and



 



   (iii)   where neither a connection permit nor a building permit is
required, on the initial date of the increased discharge which triggers the
additional payment.



 



   Where the charge has been paid on or after July 1, 1994 at a certain
rate or sewage generation factor, but the connection or building permit
referred to in (i) or (ii) above has not been issued, and the SFC rate and/or
sewage generation factor changes, the permittee shall pay the additional
amount or shall be eligible for a refund, as applicable, when the connection
permit or building permit is issued.  The amount of the additional payment
or the refund shall be the difference between the SFC calculated before and
after the changes in rate and/or sewage generation factor.  Notwithstanding
any other sections of this code, the City Engineer with Board approval is
authorized to direct the Controller to make such refunds as necessary.



 



   3.   Where application is made for a new house sewer connection
permit under Section 64.14(a) of the Municipal Code after a previous permit
has expired following its non-extendable two-year duration, and the Sewerage
Facilities Charge has been paid at a rate in effect prior to an increase in
the charge and the new  application is made after such increase, the
additional Sewerage Facilities Charge due under the rate applicable at the
time of application shall be paid as a condition of issuance of the new
permit.  (Amended by Ord. No. 168,578, Eff. 3/13/93.)



 



   4.   Effective May 1, 1989, the sewerage facilities charge rate to
be paid by the property owners for sewer connection on assessment sewer
projects will be set at the rate in effect on the date the Ordinance of
Intention is adopted by the City Council.  The sewer connection must be made
within one year after acceptance of the completed sewer by the Board of
Public Works. (Added by Ord. No. 168,082, Eff. 8/22/92.)

Availability Review (SCAR) when any person seeks a permit to connect one or
more properties to the City's sewer collection system, or proposes additional
discharge through their existing public sewer connection, or wishes to obtain
a SCAR in anticipation of a future sewer connection and that future
connection or that proposed or future development is anticipated to generate
10,000 gallons or more of sewage per day.  A SCAR is an analysis of the
existing sewer collection system to determine if there is adequate capacity
existing in the sewer collection system to safely convey the newly generated
sewage to the appropriate sewage treatment plant.  All costs incurred by the
City in performing a SCAR shall be recovered through a SCAR fee as follows:

sewage generation tables, 10,000 gallons of additional sewage per day through
their existing public sewer connection, a fee titled "Sewer Capacity
Availability Review Fee" (SCARF) to cover the cost of SCAR shall be paid to
the Board by the applicant before the SCAR is conducted.



 



   2.   The SCAR Fee or SCARF shall be based on the level of
engineering analysis and data collection required to complete the SCAR.  The
SCARF amounts are:

the Board not less than $10,000 in cash which shall remain on deposit with
the Board for not less than six months from the date of the last permit
issued to the depositor thereof.  Such deposit will be held to insure the
faithful and proper performance of the work and the payment of all charges
required by Sections 64.12 to 64.22 inclusive, and the Board is hereby
empowered to deduct from the cash deposit all sums due for charges hereunder
and for any and all damages accruing to this City by reason of faulty,
defective or incomplete work by the permittee.



 



   2.   Surety Bond in Lieu of Deposit.  Whenever in this section a
cash bond in the amount of $10,000 or over is required, the applicant may
provide in lieu of such cash deposit, a good and sufficient bond in an amount
equal to the amount of such cash deposit, payable to this City, executed by
the applicant as the principal and by a reliable surety company qualified to
do business in California and the City of Los Angeles, which bond is
satisfactory to this City.  Such bond shall be deposited with and held by
the City to insure the faithful and proper performance of the work and the
payment of all charges required by Sections 64.12 to 64.22 inclusive, upon
the same terms as those required by the cash deposit, in lieu of which, the
bond is executed.  The Board is hereby empowered to demand and receive
payment from the bond for all sums due for charges hereunder and for any and
all damages accruing to this City by reason of faulty, defective or
incomplete work by the permittee.



 



   3.   Increase in Bond Amount.  On July 1, 2009, the amount set
forth in subsections 64.15.1(b)1. and 64.15.1(b)2. for both the required cash
deposit and surety bond shall increase from $10,000 to $20,000.  On July 1,
2011, the amounts for both the required cash deposit and surety bond shall
increase from $20,000 to $25,000 and on each July 1 starting in 2012, the
amount of both the required cash deposit and surety bond shall increase
annually by the percentage amount of the increase in the consumer price index
for the previous calendar year rounded up to the nearest $100.  Starting in
2012, all current Bonded Sewer Contractors shall be notified each year by
April 1 of the new bonding requirements and the need to have a new bond in
the correct amount in place by July 1.



 



 



SEC. 64.16.  EXEMPTIONS FROM LIABILITY INSURANCE AND DEPOSIT REQUIREMENTS.



 



   From Federal Government, the State, every county, city and county,
municipal corporation, irrigation district, school district, district
established by law, and any political or administrative subdivision of the
State or Federal Government will not be required to make a deposit or to post
a policy of protective liability insurance as otherwise required by Sections
64.15 and 64.15.1.  (Amended by Ord. No. 121,900. Eff. 6/4/62.)



 



 



SEC. 64.16.1.  SEWERAGE FACILITIES CHARGE FOR SEWER CONNECTION.



 



   (a)   (Amended by Ord. No. 171,036, Eff. 6/6/96.)  Before granting
a permit to connect any lot or parcel or to connect a new building on such
lot or parcel to a public sewer or house connection sewer pursuant to the
provisions of Section 64.12 of this Code, including a replacement building
following a demolition, except applications for permits to repair or replace
existing sewer connections which repair or replacement is unrelated to any
new construction or to new use or occupancy, the Board shall require, in
addition to all other charges and fees imposed by Sections 64.12 to 64.22,
inclusive, the payment by the applicant therefor of a Sewerage Facilities
Charge fixed in accordance with Section 64.11.3.  The Board shall provide a
credit pursuant to Subsection (c).



 



   (b)   (Amended by Ord. No. 171,036, Eff. 6/6/96.)  A Sewerage
Facilities Charge, based upon the rates established in Section 64.11.3 of
this article, shall also be imposed as follows:



 



   1.   Where a physical addition is made to an existing residential
occupancy to create an additional dwelling unit or units, or where an
existing residential occupancy is modified to create an additional dwelling
unit or units, a charge shall be imposed for each additional dwelling unit on
a lot or parcel created by the addition or modification.  Where any existing
dwelling unit is enlarged or modified to create an additional bedroom or
bedrooms, a charge shall be imposed for each additional bedroom created on
the lot or parcel by the addition or modification.



 



   2.   Where an addition is made to an existing commercial building,
or an additional commercial building is constructed on a lot or parcel, a
charge shall be imposed based on the increase in gross floor area or on the
increase in such other indicator of activity as the Board may adopt.



 



   3.   Where the average flow discharge and/or the average discharge
of  mass emissions of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) and/or suspended
solids (SS) from industrial buildings on a lot or parcel are increased, a
charge shall be imposed based on the average flow and the BOD and SS mass
emissions (calculated as the flow rate multiplied by the BOD and SS
concentrations and by a unit conversion factor) following the increase.  The
Board shall provide a credit pursuant to Subsection (c).



 



   4.   Where the use or occupancy of an existing building on a lot or
parcel is changed, a Sewerage Facilities Charge shall be imposed based upon
such new use or occupancy.  The Board shall provide a credit pursuant to
Subsection (c).



 



   (c)   Whenever a credit is allowed, the credit shall be determined
by first calculating flow, BOD and SS credits and then calculating an
aggregate monetary credit.  The flow, BOD and SS credits shall remain with
the lot or parcel except as provided in Section 64.16.2 or 64.19(e). 
(Amended by Ord. No. 182,076, Eff. 4/6/12.)



 



   1.   The flow credit shall be calculated as the total of the
following:



 



   (i)   the largest average flow rate of discharge from the lot or
parcel to a public sewer determined by the City Engineer to have occurred
before establishment of the Sewerage Facilities Charge, provided that it
shall be the applicant’s responsibility to submit documented evidence
satisfactory to the City Engineer to obtain this credit; plus



 



   (ii)   the average flow rate of discharge for which a Sewerage
Facilities Charge has been paid in cash, by transferral from a
revitalization, enterprise, or empowerment zone per Section 64.16.2, or by
construction of an offsite sewer pursuant to Section 64.11.3, provided that
offsite sewer construction shall have been accomplished and its cost
documented in accordance with the policies of the City Engineer to obtain
this credit; minus



 



   (iii)   the average flow rate of discharge which is equivalent to
the flow component of any refunds which have been paid; minus



 



   (iv)   the average flow rate of discharge which has been transferred
away pursuant to Section 64.16.2.



 



   2.   The Board shall adopt rules to determine the initial BOD and SS
credits allocable to a lot or parcel upon implementation of this subsection
(c).



 



   3.   The credits for strength (BOD and SS) parameters shall be
calculated as the total of the following:



 



   (i)   the largest average rate of mass emissions discharge from the
lot or parcel to a public sewer determined by the City Engineer to have
occurred before establishment of the Sewerage Facilities Charge, provided
that it shall be the applicant’s responsibility to submit documented
evidence satisfactory to the City Engineer to obtain this credit; plus



 



   (ii)   the average rate of mass emissions discharge for which a
Sewerage Facilities Charge has been paid in cash, by transferral from a
revitalization, enterprise, or empowerment zone per Section 64.16.2, or by
construction of an offsite sewer pursuant to Section 64.11.3, provided that
offsite sewer construction shall have been accomplished and its cost
documented in accordance with the policies of the City Engineer to obtain
this credit; minus



 



   (iii)   the average rate of mass emissions discharge which is
equivalent to the mass emissions component of any refunds which have been
paid; minus



 



   (iv)   the average rate of mass emissions discharge which has been
transferred away pursuant to Section 64.16.2.



 



   The monetary credit shall be calculated by multiplying the rates
established pursuant to Section 64.11.3 at the time the Sewerage Facilities
charge was paid by the flow, BOD and SS credits and summing the results,
provided that the total credit shall not exceed the Sewerage Facilities
Charge required to be paid except as provided in Subdivision 6. of Subsection
(a) of Section 64.19.  (Amended by Ord. No. 182,076, Eff. 4/6/12.)



 



   Notwithstanding the previous sentence, in the case of reconstruction of
a building damaged by the earthquake of January 17, 1994, the amount of the
credit shall be the Sewerage Facilities Charge which would have been
applicable on January 17, 1994, or the Sewerage Facilities Charge based on
the rates established pursuant to Section 64.11.3, whichever is greater.



 



   (d)   ((c) Relettered (d) by Ord. No. 171,036, Eff. 6/6/96.)  The
Council may, in the exercise of its sound discretion, and upon advice of the
Board, reduce the sewers facilities charge for any property for which
off-site public sewers are constructed beyond the limits of said property, by
all or part of the actual cost of the construction of said off-site public
sewer.



 



   (e)   ((d) Relettered (e) by Ord. No. 171,036, Eff. 6/6/96.)  Where
the applicant meets the criteria as specified hereinafter, and enters into an
installment payment agreement with the Board, the applicant shall be allowed
to pay the Sewerage Facilities Charge as follows:  a down payment of 15
percent of the Sewerage Facilities Charge due, or more at the applicant’s
option, followed by quarterly installments extending over a period not to
exceed five (5) years at such interest rate as the Board shall establish
annually in July of each year.  The rate shall be the simple average of the
last available twelve months’ average interest earnings from the pool in
which Sewer Construction and Maintenance Fund moneys are invested, as
reported by the City Treasurer and rounded to the nearest tenth of one
percent, plus one percent.



 



   EXCEPTION:  Interest shall not be charged to a charitable institution
as defined in Item No. 2 below.  Quarterly installments shall be in the
amount necessary to fully amortize the Sewerage Facilities Charge, excluding
the down payment, and interest over the payment period.



 



   The Board shall also establish a fixed fee to cover setup and
administrative costs associated with the installment plan.  This fee shall
be determined as provided in Section 12.37-I,1 of the Los Angeles Municipal
Code.  If the applicant is a lessee, the installment payment period shall
not exceed the remaining period of time the applicant is to occupy the
subject property under the terms of the lease agreement.  Provisions in the
lease agreement for termination of the lease upon the occurrence of certain
events shall not prevent the lessee from entering into an installment
agreement.



 



   The applicant must meet one or more of the following criteria:



 



   1.   The applicant’s property is an individual site in which the
Sewerage Facilities Charge due equals or exceeds $17,000.  “Individual
site” shall not include a subdivision with more than one sewer connection.



 



   2.   The applicant is a charitable institution and the Sewerage
Facilities Charge due equals or exceeds $5,000.  For the purpose of this
subsection, a charitable institution shall be an institution which meets the
five criteria listed in Subsection (f) of this section.



 



   3.   The applicant is a surgical hospital.



 



   4.   The applicant is a property owner who is ceasing to use a
private sewage disposal system and is connecting to the City sewage system.



 



   (f)   ((e) Relettered (f) by Ord. No. 171,036, Eff. 6/6/96.) 
Whenever the Board has authorized an installment payment agreement to be
entered into pursuant to Subsection (e), the following requirements shall
apply:



 



   1.   The first quarterly payment under the installment payment
agreement shall be due on the first day of the third month next succeeding
the month in which the down payment was made.  Remaining payments shall be
due on the first day of every third month thereafter.



 



   2.   A payment shall become delinquent if not postmarked on or
before the 15th of the month in which it is due.  All delinquent payments
shall incur a penalty charge of 10 percent of the cumulative amount of all
delinquent payments, including previous delinquency charges.  Said
delinquency charge must be paid in full before normal payments will again be
accepted.



 



   3.   If a payment remains unpaid beyond the 15th day of the third
month next succeeding the date on which it became delinquent, the permittee
shall be determined in default.  The Board shall notify the permittee, and,
in addition, the owner of the property if different from the permittee, by
certified mail with return receipt that:



 



   A.   The permittee and/or the owner have one month from the default
date to bring the balance current or the entire unpaid plan amount, including
delinquent charges, will become due and payable; and



 



   B.   The connection permit may be canceled and the connection
severed if the permittee  continues in default beyond that date.



 



   4.   If the permittee remains in default for one month and 10 days,
the Board may cancel the Sewer Connection Permit and sever the connection. 
The Board shall notify the permittee, the owner, if different from the
permittee, and the Superintendent of the Department of Building and Safety at
least 10 days before taking such action.



 



   5.   Where title to a premises subject to an installment payment
agreement is sold or transferred, and the permittee is the owner of said
property, the entire unpaid balance of the charge shall immediately become
due and payable and the permittee and the new owner of the property shall be
jointly and severally liable for said amount.  The installment payment
agreement shall provide for the creation of a lien against the subject
property to secure payment to the City, at time of sale, of the unpaid
balance of the Sewerage Facilities Charge and any accrued penalty charges. 
The lien shall be recorded with the County Recorder by means of a covenant
executed by the parties.



 



   6.   In the event the permittee is a lessee on the property, the
entire unpaid balance of the charge shall immediately become due and payable
upon termination of the leasehold interest for whatever reason, including
termination of the lease or assignment of the leasehold interest, and the
permittee shall be liable for said amount.  The installment payment
agreement shall provide for the creation of a lien against the leasehold
interest of the lessee to secure payment to the City of the unpaid balance of
the Sewerage Facilities Charge and any accrued penalty charges at the time of
termination of the leasehold interest.  Such lien requirement shall not be
imposed, however, if the lessee would violate the lease agreement in so
doing, or is unable to obtain the consent of the lessor where such is
required by the lease.  The lien shall be recorded with the County Recorder
by means of a covenant executed by the parties.  In the event of leasehold
termination, the lessor may assume the obligation of payment of the unpaid
balance under the installment payment agreement but will be required to
comply with all provisions of this section which are applicable to owners who
are permittees.



 



   7.   Delinquent charges and all penalties thereon as to any
permittee, whether lessee or owner, shall constitute a lien on the real
property served when recorded as provided in Section 54355 of the Government
Code of the State of California and such lien shall continue until the charge
and all penalties thereon are fully paid or the property sold therefor.



 



   8.   All or part of any unpaid plan amount may be paid in advance at
any time.



 



   9.   When all moneys under the plan have been paid in full, a Sewer
Facilities Charge certificate of payment will be issued.



 



   (g)   ((f) Relettered (g) by Ord. No. 171,036, Eff. 6/6/96.)  Where
the applicant is a charitable hospital, it shall be exempt from sewerage
facilities charges. A hospital is charitable, for the purpose of this
subsection if:



 



   1.   It is not operated for profit;



 



   2.   No part of its assets inures to the benefit of any private
shareholder or individual;



 



   3.   Its assets are irrevocably dedicated for a charitable purpose;



 



   4.   Upon dissolution, its assets shall be distributed to an
organization exempt for charitable purposes from taxation under the Revenue
and Taxation Code or the Internal Revenue Code.



 



   5.   The applicant has obtained a charitable purpose tax exemption
determination from the California Franchise Tax Board.



 



   (h)   ((g) Relettered (h) by Ord. No. 171,036, Eff. 6/6/96.)



 



   1.   Where the Board finds that an applicant presently discharging,
as of the date of this ordinance, into the Los Angeles Harbor has been
ordered by a State and/or Federal agency to so cease discharging and, as a
result, must therefore connect to the City sewer system, the Board may permit
the applicant to defer payment of such sewage facilities charge for a two
year period from the date of the application for the sewer connection permit.
If at the end of such two year period the property which was connected to the
City’s sewer system pursuant to such deferment of payment is no longer so
connected no sewerage facilities charge will be imposed. The granting of such
deferment of payment is subject to the applicant entering into an agreement
to pay the amount deferred if the subject property is still connected to the
City’s sewer system at the end of the two year period.  (Para. numbered
1., Amended  by Ord. No. 153,056, Eff. 10/29/79.)



 



   2.   (Added by Ord. No. 153,056, Eff. 10/29/79.)  As to any
applicant granted such a deferment as provided above the Board may grant a
deferment for an additional eighteen month period provided at the time
application is made for such extension the applicant is actively seeking
permission from the appropriate authorities to be permitted to discharge into
the Los Angeles Harbor. If at the end of such eighteen month extension the
property which was connected to the City’s sewer system pursuant to such
deferment of payment is no longer so connected no sewerage facilities charge
will be imposed. The granting of such extended deferment is subject to the
applicant entering into an agreement, or amending its existing agreement,
with the City to pay the amount deferred if the subject property is still
connected to the City’s sewer system at the end of the eighteen month
extension period.



 



   (i)   ((h) Relettered (i) by Ord. No. 171,036, Eff. 6/6/96.)  The
sewerage facilities charge fees applicable to single family dwellings as of
September 1, 1986, shall be applicable to a sewer connection by a single
family dwelling to a sewer when:



 



   1.   The sewer was installed pursuant to an assessment proceeding
where the petition therefore was on file with the City as of September
1,1986; and



 



   2.   The connection is made within one year after acceptance of the
completed sewer by the Board.



 



   (j)   ((i) Relettered (j) by Ord. No. 171,036, Eff. 6/6/96.)  Where
the applicant is a non-profit corporation it shall be exempt from sewerage
facilities charges required for a dwelling structure it is constructing, or
substantially rehabilitating, to serve low-income elderly and/or handicapped
families or individuals if the construction or rehabilitation of said
structure is being government funded and the dwelling is on property being
leased from the city, or on property which has been, or will be, acquired
from the City with the City having an option to re-acquire the property. A
corporation is non-profit, for the purpose of this section, if:



 



   (1)   The purposes of the corporation include the promotion of the
welfare of elderly and/or handicapped families and/or individuals;



 



   (2)   No part of the net earnings of the corporation may inure to
the benefit of any private shareholder, contributor or individual; and



 



   (3)   The corporation is not controlled by, or under the direction
of, persons or firms seeking to derive profit or gain therefrom.



 



   (k)   ((j) Relettered (k) by Ord. No. 171,036, Eff. 6/6/96.) 
(Repealed by Ord. No. 170,083, Eff. 11/26/94, Oper. 7/1/94.)



 



   (l)   (Added by Ord. No. 169,042, Eff. 9/14/93.)  Where an alcohol
retail business was damaged or destroyed in the 1992 civil disturbance, the
sewerage facilities charge shall be waived where the specific site, or an
area encompassing the specific site, where such business was or is located,
is to be converted to another use not involving the sale of alcoholic
beverages.  In case the new use is to be a non-industrial laundromat, such
waiver will be to the extent of the use of a maximum of sixty (60) washing
machines; provided, however, if the new use is something other than a
laundromat, the waiver available shall be equivalent to the amount of the
sewerage facilities charge payable for a laundromat containing sixty (60)
washing machines.  As a condition to obtaining such a waiver of the sewerage
facilities charge, the alcohol retail licensee must submit proof of the
cancellation of the license issued by the State Alcoholic Beverage Control
Department for the particular alcohol retail business which was damaged or
destroyed, at the time of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy.



 



   Such conversion to a new use having occurred, if there should be a
further or different conversion then the credit utilized in determining the
appropriate sewerage facilities charge shall be based upon the  applicable
sewerage facilities flow credit prior to the 1992 civil disturbance.



 



   This section shall be non-operative two (2) years after its effective
date.



 



   (m)   (Added by Ord. No. 171,036, Eff. 6/6/96.)  Notwithstanding
Subsection (a) of this section, where the application is for the connection
of a temporary field office at a construction site to a sewer, no Sewerage
Facilities Charge shall be collected.



 



 



SEC. 64.16.2.  TRANSFER OF INDUSTRIAL FLOW SEWERAGE FACILITIES CHARGE
CREDITS WITHIN OR BETWEEN REVITALIZATION, ENTERPRISE OR EMPOWERMENT ZONES.



   (Added by Ord. No. 169,347, Eff. 3/12/94.)



 



   Manufacturing and industrial businesses, including laundromats, where
the estimated quantity of discharge for Sewerage Facilities Charge purposes
is based upon the process used or number of machines and have an existing
City of Los Angeles industrial flow Sewerage Facilities Charge credit may
transfer all or part of this credit within or between a Revitalization,
Enterprise or Empowerment Zone(s) or into a Revitalization, Enterprise or
Empowerment Zone as defined in State or Federal law subject to the following
conditions:



 



   (a)   A Sewerage Facilities Charge credit for the empty building
shell(s) or most recent improvements if the land is vacant shall remain with
the donor site.



 



   (b)   A Sewerage Facilities Charge must be paid or already exist for
the building shell(s) at the receiver site.



 



   (c)   Local sewer availability and capacity at the receiver site to
handle the transferred sewage flow must be verified by the City Engineer. 
An additional mainline sewer must be constructed at no cost to the City to a
point of available capacity as determined by the City Engineer if local
capacity does not exist.



 



   (d)   Only one transfer from a donor site to a receiver site shall
be permitted and no transfer from a receive site back to a donor site shall
be permitted.



 



   (e)   Any increase in sewer discharge at either the donor or
receiver site over the adjusted sewer discharge flows established after the
transfer at either site, shall require the payment of additional Sewerage
Facilities Charge at the rate in effect at the time of the flow increase.



 



   (f)   A current Title Report must be submitted to the City Engineer
verifying the ownership of the donor site from which flow credits are to be
taken.



 



   (g)   If the person(s) requesting the transfer of flow credit is not
the owner of the donor site, a notarized assignment of sewer discharge
credits from the property owner to the person(s) requesting the transfer of
the sewer discharge credits is required.  This assignment can not be
executed until it has been approved and signed by the City Engineer. 
Falsification of these documents will invalidate the transfer request and may
result in referral to the City Attorney or District Attorney for prosecution.



 



   (h)   A non-refundable fee of $250 must be paid to initiate and
document the transfer of Sewerage Facilities Charge flow credits.  This fee
shall be deposited directly into the Sewer Construction and Maintenance
Fund.  The fee herein shall be adjusted, if required, in order to recover
the City’s administrative costs, and adopted in the same manner as provided
in Section 12.37-I,1 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code for establishing fees.



 



   (i)   The transfer of the sewer discharge must be initiated by
submitting construction plans to the Department of Building and Safety for
the receiver site within one year of approval of the transfer request.  A

SEC. 64.17.  SEWER CONNECTION REGULATIONS.



 



   No person having obtained a permit from the Board shall construct,
alter, or repair any house connection sewer or any portion of any house
connection sewer, or makes a connection to any public sewer, or house
connection sewer, pursuant to any such permit, at any place other than that
designated thereon, or fail, refuse or neglect to comply with any such
requirement contained or referred to in this section.



 



   At all times, while the work under any such permit is in progress, the
original of such permit must be kept at the place of the work and must, on
demand be exhibited to the Board or to any of its inspectors, agents or
representatives, or to any police officer.



 



   (a)   In those streets and alleys included in that portion of this
City, designated by Chapter 8 of this Code as the Central Traffic District,
when an excavation is commenced, the making of the excavation, the work to be
done therein and the refilling of the excavation, shall be prosecuted
diligently and continuously until completed, so as not to obstruct the street
or other public place or travel thereon, more than is actually necessary.



 



   (b)   The construction of all house connection sewers, and all
repairs to such house connection sewers, shall be as follows:



 



   1.   All pipe shall be clay, cement, cast iron, ABS and PVC plastic
pipe or asbestos cement and have a minimum internal diameter of six inches.
(Amended by Ord. No. 152,157, Eff. 5/13/79)



 



   2.   House connection sewers in easements over private property
shall be constructed of only clay pipe with flexible joints, ABS and PVC
plastic pipe or cast iron pipe, and may have an internal diameter of four or
six inches. (Amended by Ord. No. 152,157, Eff. 5/13/79)



 



   3.   Upon proper application to the Board, the Board may permit the
increase in the internal diameter of house connection sewers to not more than
two inches less than the internal diameter of the public sewer to which it is
connected, if such increased diameter is in accordance with good engineering
practice.



 



   4.   The quality of the pipe, the type of joint and other materials
used, the manner of constructing house connection sewers, the backfilling of
the trench, except where specifically provided for herein, or by the Board,
shall be the same as is required by the latest specifications and standard
plans for the construction of sanitary sewers in this City.



 



   (c)   Whenever, in connection with the construction or repair of a
sewer connection, a hazardous excavation must be made or an excavation is to
be made by tunneling under the surface of a street or alley, the Board may
adopt such regulations and require such special inspections as it may deem
necessary. The cost of such special inspection shall be estimated by the
Board and paid as outlined in Section 64.15.



 



   (d)   All house connection sewers, unless otherwise authorized by
the Board, shall be laid on a uniform grade of not less than two per cent,
with a depth, measured to the invert, at the property line, of not less than
four feet below the top of the existing curb or proposed curb at the nearest
point. If there is no existing or proposed curb, then such house connection
sewers shall be laid on a uniform grade of not less than two per cent, with a
depth, measured to the invert, not less than four feet below the surface of
the roadway, sidewalk or alley at the property line, unless a greater depth
is required to serve such property.



 



   (e)   (None)



 



   (f)   Where a building is on or immediately adjacent to the property
line, to which a sewer connection must be constructed, and an existing house
sewer from said building ends at such property line at a depth of less than
the depth required in this section for the upper end of a house connection
sewer to be constructed to such property line; or where an earth bank over 4
feet in height exists adjacent to the curb line or property line, the Board
shall adopt such regulations, for the construction of that portion of the
house connection sewer between the curb line and property line, if in a
street, and between the main sewer and the property line, if in an alley,
walk or other public place improved or to be improved without a curb, which
will meet such conditions better than the method of construction herein
prescribed.



 



   Where a main sewer exceeds 14 feet in depth the manner of constructing
a house connection sewer from such a sewer shall be regulated by the Board.



 



   (g)   (Amended by Ord. No. 142,123, Eff. 7/31/71.)  Persons making
an excavation in any street or sidewalk for any of the purposes mentioned in
Sections 64.12 to 64.22 inclusive, must maintain free access to all fire
hydrants and water gates. All materials excavated shall be laid compactly
along the side of the trench and kept trimmed up so as to cause as little
inconvenience as possible to public travel. If any excavation is made across
any street or alley, at least one safe crossing must be maintained at all
times for vehicles and pedestrians. Where required to keep traffic lanes and
sidewalk passageways clear, tight board fences shall be used to hold
excavated material. All gutters must be maintained free and unobstructed for
the full depth of the adjacent curb and for at least one (1) foot in width
from the face of such curb at the gutter line. All work shall be performed in
accordance with the latest adopted manual entitled “Work Area Traffic
Control”, the latest adopted “Standard Specifications for Public Works
Construction”, any required plans and special specifications and shall be
performed to the satisfaction of the Board.



 



   If the warning signs, lights and devices required under this section
are not promptly provided, the Board may provide them; the cost of such work
performed by the Board may be billed to the permittee.



 



   (h)   Any excavation made for the purpose of making a house
connection to a sewer shall be refilled in the manner required by this
article within three days after inspection of the pipe by the Board, or
within three days after the date of the completion of the excavation if no
work is done therein. Nothing in this article contained shall be construed to
allow a longer period of time therefor.



 



   The top surface of the backfill shall conform closely enough to the
level of the adjoining street or sidewalk surface and shall be compacted so
that it is hard enough and smooth enough to be safe for pedestrian travel
over it as well as for vehicular traffic to pass safely over it at a legal
rate of speed. The permittee shall maintain the surface of the backfill in a
condition safe for pedestrian and vehicular traffic until the said surface
has been repaired by the Board, and said permittee shall be responsible for
all accidents which may occur due to pedestrians traveling over or upon the
site of the excavation as well as vehicles crossing said site at a legal rate
of speed, until said surface has been so repaired. (Amended by Ord. No.
142,123, Eff. 7/31/71.)



 



   If it is impracticable to maintain the surface of the backfill in safe
condition for pedestrian travel or vehicular traffic, subject to concurrence
by the inspector, then the permittee shall maintain barriers and lights
around it in accordance with Subsection (g) hereof until the sidewalk and
street pavements have been repaired.  (Added by Ord. No. 142,123, Eff.
7/31/71.)



 



   (i)   The street surface excavated or damaged shall be replaced by
the Board, and the cost thereof shall be recovered by the Board in accordance
with the provisions of Section 62.05 of this Code. (Amended by Ord. No.
121,900, Eff. 6/4/62.)



 



   (j)   In all cases where the public records of a public sewer, or
house connection sewer, do not correctly represent the existing condition of
or conditions surrounding such sewer, or where, in the opinion of the Board,
the physical conditions are such that strict compliance with the provisions
of Section 64.12 to Section 64.22, inclusive, if unnecessary or unreasonable,
the Board is granted the power to make modifications for individual cases,
and determine the procedure to be followed, and its decision shall be final.



 



   (k)   No person shall connect a 4-inch house sewer to a 6-inch house
connection sewer without first installing a 6-inch by 4-inch by 4-inch
increaser tee on the end of the 6-inch house connection sewer, or a six-inch
by 4-inch increaser followed by a 4-inch by 4-inch by 4-inch tee branch.

identified in Subdivision 3. of this Subsection was caused by the use of
water conservation practices, pretreatment of discharge, or use of
environmentally responsible practices; and



 



   5.   The SIU, at the time of submission of the written claim to the

authorized to accept said sewer as a public sewer at such time as the Council
has accepted all necessary easements therefor and the parties in interest,
abovementioned, will be entitled to continue to use said sewer facilities
without the payment to the City of any permit or other special fees or
charges except those required by Section 64.15.



 



   (d)   City Engineer Approval Required. No permit shall be granted

SEC. 64.26.  MANDATORY ABANDONMENT OF PRIVATE SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEMS.



   (Added by Ord. No. 160,388, Eff. 10/21/85.)



 



   A.   General Provisions.



 



   1.   Purpose. The purpose of this section is to protect and preserve
the water quality of the groundwater basins located generally in the San
Fernando Valley and certain adjacent areas by phasing out the use of private
sewage disposal systems employed by commercial and industrial uses, and in
multiple residential units. The continued use of private sewage disposal
systems by commercial and industrial uses in the San Fernando Valley and
certain adjacent areas is declared to be a threat to the quality of the
ground water and to the public health. Therefore, the City is providing a
systematic method of requiring both the connection to public sewers and
permanent abandonment of private sewage disposal systems.



 



   2.   Scope. This section shall apply to all private sewage disposal
systems in the City of Los Angeles located northerly of the boundary line
described as follows:



 



   Beginning from the west at the intersection of Mulholland Highway and
the City boundary, thence along Mulholland Highway in a northerly direction
to the intersection with Mulholland Drive, thence along Mulholland Drive in
an easterly direction to the intersection of Mulholland Drive and Laurel
Canyon Boulevard, thence northerly along Laurel Canyon Boulevard to the
intersection of Laurel Canyon Boulevard and the Los Angeles River, thence
along the Los Angeles River in an easterly and then southerly direction to
the intersection of the Los Angeles River and the Glendale Freeway, thence
along the Glendale Freeway in a northerly direction to the City boundary.



 



   B.   Definitions.  For purposes of this section, “Notice to
Connect” shall mean a notice to connect to a public sewer and to abandon a
Private Sewage Disposal System (PSDS) as defined at Number 42.5 in Section
64.00 of this Code.



 



   C.   Issuance Of Notice To Connect To The Public Sewer And To
Abandon A PSDS.



 



   1.   Issuance by Director.  When connection to a public sewer is
available or becomes available for a lot upon which a PSDS is located, the
Director shall issue a Notice to Connect to the owner of the lot as
identified on the Los Angeles County equalized assessment roll or as known to
the City Engineer.  The Director may, in addition, issue a copy of a Notice
to Connect to any person using or maintaining the PSDS.  (Amended by Ord.
No. 181,595, Eff. 4/10/11.)



 



   (a)   When Sewer is “Available”. A public sewer is available
when it is located in any public street or easement abutting a lot.



 



   (b)   Phasing. The Board shall adopt standards for the issuance of
Notices to Connect to be administered on a phased basis. The standards shall
permit the Director to give priority to lots located in areas where the
Department of Water and Power has determined the underlying groundwater has
been contaminated by industrial chemicals.



 



   (c)   Exemption. If a PSDS is in compliance with all applicable
laws, rules, and regulations, and is located on a lot occupied by four or
fewer units which are used solely for residential purposes, it shall be
exempt from the requirements of this section and the Director shall not issue
a Notice to Connect for such PSDS.



 



   2.   Time for Compliance. The Notice to Connect shall be fully
complied with no later than one year from the date of issuance of the Notice
to Connect, provided however, that if the Director finds that a PSDS is not
in compliance with any applicable law, rule, or regulation, the Notice to
Connect shall provide for full compliance within 30 days of the issuance of
the Notice to Connect.



 



   3.   Contents of a Notice to Connect. A Notice to Connect shall;



 



   (a)   identify, by address, the property to which it is directed;



 



   (b)   state that the Director has determined that a public sewer is
available for that lot;



 



   (c)   require discontinued use of the PSDS after the time specified
in the notice and connection to a public sewer, or vacation of the premises;



 



   (d)   require full compliance within the time limit specified in the
Notice;



 



   (e)   describe the procedures whereby an application for variance
may be filed within 90 days of the date of issuance of the Notice to Connect;
and



 



   (f)   advise that failure to comply may result in discontinuance of
water service and referral to the City Attorney for appropriate criminal
and/or civil action.



 



   The Notice to Connect may also include references to the payment of
fees and the procedures for obtaining any required permits for connection to
a public sewer and abandonment of the PSDS.



 



   At the time of issuance of the Notice to Connect, the Director shall
provide to the person to whom the Notice is issued a document which briefly
explains the purpose and scope of the program and its system of
administration, and indicates whom to contact for further information.



 



   4.   Subsequent Notices. The Director shall issue the following
subsequent notices in cases where the Notice to Connect provides for full
compliance within one year:



 



   (a)   Reminder Notice. If full compliance with the requirements of a
Notice to Connect has not been achieved four months prior to the date
specified for such full compliance in the Notice to Connect, the Director
shall issue a Reminder Notice which shall repeat the deadline for compliance
and the possible sanctions for failure to comply;



 



   (b)   Final Notice. If full compliance with the requirements of a
Notice to Connect has not been achieved one month prior to the date specified
for such full compliance in the Notice to Connect, the Director shall issue a
Final Notice which shall repeat the deadline for compliance and the possible
sanctions for failure to comply.



 



   5.   Service of Notices. Each of the Notices described in this
section shall be either personally delivered or sent by certified mail with
return receipt requested.



 



   6.   Effect of Failure To Issue or Receive Subsequent Notices.
Failure to issue or receive a Reminder Notice, Final Notice, or Notice of
Violation shall not relieve any owner or person using or maintaining a PSDS
from the duty to comply with the Notice to Connect and shall not be a defense
to a criminal or civil enforcement action.



 



   D.   Compliance With Notice To Connect:  Every owner of a lot upon
which a PSDS is located, and every person using or maintaining a PSDS, shall
comply with the requirements of a Notice to Connect, or Notice to Connect
modified by any variance granted in accordance with Subsection E of this
section which is issued for that PSDS. Notwithstanding any other provision of
this Code to the contrary, no person shall permit or cause the discharge of
any wastewater to a PSDS after the compliance date specified in a Notice to
Connect issued for that PSDS, as modified by any variance granted in
accordance with Subsection E of this section.



 



   E.   Variances



 



   1.   Application to Director. Any person who owns, uses, or
maintains a PSDS which is in compliance with all applicable laws, rules, and
regulations who has received a Notice to Connect, upon payment of a fee of
$100, may file with the Director within 90 days of the date of issuance of
the Notice to Connect, an application for a variance from the requirements of
this section.



 



   2.   Discretion of Director. The Director may grant a variance from
the requirements of this section, including an extension of the deadline for
compliance specified in a Notice to Connect, if the Director finds that the
applicant has demonstrated that:



 



   (a)   the strict application of the requirements of this section
will result in extreme hardships unessential to the overall purpose of such
requirements; and



 



   (b)   the continued operation of the subject PSDS will not have any
significant adverse effect upon water quality in the groundwater basin of
concern.



 



   The determination of the Director shall be supported by written
findings of fact. The Director may impose reasonable conditions upon the
granting of a variance, including a requirement that connection to a public
sewer and disconnection and abandonment of a PSDS occur within 60 days or a
change of ownership of the property.



 



   The effective period of any variance granted to an applicant shall not
exceed two years. Renewal of a variance shall be required by the applicant in
writing and shall be at the discretion of the Director in accordance with the
provisions of this subsection.



 



   The Director shall act upon an application for a variance within 60
days of its filing.



 



   3.   Appeal to Board. An appeal from a determination by the Director
may be filed with the Board by the applicant or any person aggrieved by the
determination upon payment of a fee of $100, or by any officer, board,
department or bureau of the City. Appeals shall be filed with the Secretary
of the Board within fifteen days of the Director’s action on the
application for variance. The Board, after notice duly given, shall hear and
act upon the appeal, within 90 days of its filing. If the Board fails to act
within 90 days of the filing of an appeal, the decision of the Director shall
be deemed affirmed. In considering appeals the Board shall be subject to the
same limitations as are applicable to the Director under Paragraph 2 of this
subsection.



 



   4.   Appeal to Council. If the applicant for a variance or any other
person aggrieved, or any officer, board, department or bureau of the City is
dissatisfied with the Board’s determination; or if the Board has failed to
act within 90 days of the filing of an appeal, a new appeal may be taken to
the City Council upon payment of a fee of $100. Appeals to the City Council
shall be filed with the City Clerk within 15 days of the Board’s
determination or the close of the 90 days in which the Board may act,
whichever comes first. The City Council shall act upon the appeal within 90
days of its filing. If the City Council fails to act within 90 days of the
filing of an appeal either the decision of the Board shall become final or,
if the Board failed to act within 90 days, the decision of the Director shall
become final. In considering appeals the Council shall be subject to the same
limitations applicable to the Director under Paragraph 2 of this subsection.



 



   5.   Fee Waiver. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code
to the contrary, no department, bureau, officer or board of this City shall
pay any fee required by this section for appeal.



 



   F.   Rules And Regulations.  The Board may adopt rules or
regulations governing the procedures to be followed in carrying out the
provisions of this section.



 



   G.   Enforcement.



 



   1.   If full enforcement with the requirements of this section has
not been achieved by the deadline for full compliance provided in the Notice
to Connect, as modified by any variance, the Director shall do all of the
following:



 



   (a)   issue a Notice of Violation to the owner of the affected
property and the person using or maintaining the PSDS.



 



   (b)   provide to the City Attorney copies of the applicable Notice
to Connect, Reminder Notice, Final Notice, and Notice of Violation, and proof
that such notices were delivered or mailed, together with any responses to
such notices which may have been received by the Director, and the records
concerning any application for variance and any appeal therefrom which may
have been filed.



 



   (c)   provide to the Department of Water and Power a copy of the

hereby declared to be a public nuisance and the Director may request the
Superintendent of Building to order that the subject building be vacated and
remain vacated until full compliance with the Notice to Connect has been
achieved.



 



   2.   Upon receipt of the Notice of Violation and request described
in this subsection, the Department of Water and Power shall initiate
procedures to discontinue water services, if specified by the Director, after
providing reasonable notice thereof to the occupying party and the owner of
the property, and the Department of Building and Safety. Upon receipt of
notification from the Director that compliance has been achieved, the
Department of Water and Power shall act to reinstitute normal water service.



 



   3.   Notwithstanding any provision of this Code to the contrary,
upon receipt of the Notice of Violation and notice that the Department of
Water and Power intends to discontinue water service, the Superintendent of
Building shall order the subject building to be vacated in accordance with
the procedures set forth in Section 91.8903 of this Code.

   A.   General Provisions.



 



   1.   Policy.  It is the policy of the City of Los Angeles to assure
that the highest and best use of the Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) is
for the collection, treatment and disposal of domestic wastewater. The use of
this system for industrial wastewater is a privilege which is subject to the
requirements of this section.



 



   2.   Objectives.  This section sets forth uniform requirements for
dischargers to the POTW. Through a permit and inspection program administered
under the jurisdiction of the Board, the City seeks to comply with all
applicable State and Federal laws.



 



   As a part of the permit and inspection program provided herein, the
Board and the Director shall have the power, jurisdiction, and supervision
over places of discharge of wastewater into the POTW, necessary to adequately
enforce and administer all laws and lawful standards and orders, or special
orders, to assure the implementation of the following objectives:



 



   (a)   Prevent any discharge into the POTW which may interfere with
the operations thereof;

following the slug discharge, the discharger shall submit to the Director a
detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge, corrective
action taken and measures to be taken to prevent future occurrences.  Such
notification shall not relieve the discharger of liability or fines incurred
as a result of this slug discharge.



 



   (d)   Notice to Employees; Notification to Director of Slug
Discharge.  A legible, understandable and conspicuously placed notice shall
be permanently posted on the discharger's bulletin board or other prominent
place advising employees to call the Director, in the event of a slug
discharge, as soon as possible or within one hour of the discharge, and to
provide at least the information listed below.  In the event that the
discharger's employees use a language other than English as a primary
language, the notice shall be worded in both English and the language or
languages involved.  The notice shall set forth the current phone number of
the Director and shall identify the following as the minimum necessary
information which is to be provided to the Director:



 



   (1)   Time, location, type, concentration and volume of discharge.



 



   (2)   Corrective action taken.  Employers shall insure that all
employees in a position to cause or allow a slug discharge to occur are
advised of this notification procedure.



 



   (e)   Notification of Potential for Slug Discharges.  Dischargers
are required to notify the Director immediately of any changes at its
facility affecting the potential for a slug discharge.



 



   (f)   Slug Discharge Control Plan(s).  The Director shall evaluate
whether each discharger needs a slug discharge control plan or other action
to control slug discharges.  The Director may require any discharger to
develop, submit for approval and implement such a plan, or take such other
action that may be necessary to control slug discharges.  Alternatively, the
Director may develop such a plan for any discharger.  A slug discharge
control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:



 



   (1)   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine
batch discharges;



 



   (2)   Description of stored chemicals;

slug discharge; and



 



   (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or
slug discharge.  Such procedures must address, but are not limited to,
inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of
materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff,
worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures
for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures
and equipment for emergency response.



 



   6.   Bypass.



 



   (a)   Bypass Not Violating Applicable Pretreatment Standards or
Requirements.  A discharger may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause Pretreatment Standards or Requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These
bypasses are not subject to the provision of Paragraphs (b) and (c).



 



   (b)   Notice.



 



   (1)   If a discharger knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it
shall submit prior notice to the Director, if possible, at least ten days
before the date of the bypass.



 



   (2)   A discharger shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated
bypass that exceeds applicable Pretreatment Standards to the Director within
24 hours from the time the discharger becomes aware of the bypass.  A
written submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the
discharger becomes aware of the bypass.  The written submission shall
contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the
bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken
or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.  The
Director may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral
report has been received within 24 hours.



 



   (c)   Prohibition of Bypass.



 



   (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Director may take enforcement
action against a discharger for a bypass, unless;



 



   (i)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury or severe property damage;



 



   (ii)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as
the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime.  This condition is
not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which
occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative
maintenance; and



 



   (iii)   The discharger submitted notices as required under Paragraph
(b) of this section.



 



   (2)   The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after
considering its adverse effects, if the Director determines that the bypass
will meet the three conditions previously listed in Paragraph (c)(1).

   (15)   Other conditions deemed appropriate by the Director to ensure
compliance with this section.



 



   (e)   Change of Ownership or Location.  An Industrial Wastewater
Permit shall not be transferable, by operation of law or otherwise, either
from one location to another, or from one person to another. For purposes of
this subdivision, statutory mergers or name changes shall not constitute a
transfer or a change in ownership. Following a change in ownership, and upon
application for a new Industrial Wastewater Permit, a temporary permit may be
issued by the Director for a period of no more than 180 days pending the
issuance of such new permit.



 



   (f)   Delayed Commencement of Discharge.  All permitted
dischargers, except dischargers undergoing construction, must commence the
discharge within 180 days from the effective date of the Industrial
Wastewater Permit or the permit is deemed void.



 



   (g)   Duration of Industrial Wastewater Permit.  Except as
otherwise provided herein, Industrial Wastewater Permits may be issued for a
specified time period and may be subject to expiration and renewal as
determined by the Director.  Industrial Wastewater Permits for Significant
Industrial Users shall have a duration or effective life not to exceed three
(3) years from the date of initial issuance or reissuance.



 



   (h)   Permit Renewal.  Applications for permit renewal shall be
filed with the Director a minimum of ninety (90) days prior to the permit
expiration date.



 



   (i)   Administrative Permit Cancellation.  As part of permit
administration, the Director may cancel any Industrial Wastewater Permit with
the express written consent of the permittee or upon verification that one or
more of the following conditions exist:



 



   (1)   The permittee is not a batch treatment discharger and has
permanently ceased the discharging of industrial wastewater to the POTW; or
changes in the industrial process or reduction of discharge levels occur such
that an Industrial Wastewater Permit is no longer required as provided by the
exemption provisions of this subsection; or



 



   (2)   Changes in industrial process or reduction of discharge levels
occur such that an Industrial Wastewater Permit is no longer required as
provided by the exemption provisions of this subsection; or



 



   (3)   Change of business ownership; or



 



   (4)   Change or abandonment of the site or location described by the
permit.



 



   (j)   Permit Reinstatement.  Notwithstanding any other provisions
of this Code, a permit which has been administratively canceled pursuant to
Paragraph (i) of this subdivision, shall be reinstated upon the written
request of the permittee and upon approval by  the Director.  Request for
reinstatement under this paragraph must be made within 180 days from the
effective date of cancellation.  Administrative permit cancellation,
pursuant to Paragraph (i) of this subdivision, shall not be used in lieu of
the enforcement remedy set forth for permit suspension or revocation, as
provided in Subsection E. of this section.



 



   (k)   Private Septage Disposal Facilities (PSDF).  PSDFs
discharging to the POTW shall be subject to all provisions of this Section
including the following specific requirements.



 



   (1)   PSDF’s shall be required to maintain an Industrial
Wastewater Permit. Exemptions under Paragraph (c) of Subdivision 1. of
Subsection C. of this Section shall not apply to private septage disposal
facilities.



 



   (2)   All waste discharged through a PSDF shall be subject to
discharge prohibitions under Subdivision 1. of Subsection B. of Section 64.30
and specific pollutant limitations under Subdivision 2. of Subsection B. of
Section 64.30.



 



   (3)   In cases where hauled septage is discharged at a facility in
addition to any discharge from any other industrial operations performed at
that site, a separate industrial wastewater permit shall be required
specifically for the discharge of hauled septage in addition to any other
required industrial wastewater permit(s).



 



   (4)   (Amended by Ord. No. 174,047, Eff. 8/5/01.)  Additional
regulations regarding the operation of PSDFs are specified in the Board’s
Rules and Regulations.  All PSDFs shall be required to comply with these
Rules and Regulations.



 



   (l)   Food Service Establishment (FSE) Requirements.



 



   (1)   All FSEs must implement and demonstrate compliance with Best
Management Practices (BMP) requirements as specified in the Board's Rules and
Regulations.



 



   (2)   FSEs that are required to maintain an Industrial Wastewater
Permit are also required to install, operate and maintain an approved type
and adequately sized, remotely located and readily accessible, gravity grease
interceptor unless a conditional waiver is granted by the Director.



 



   (3)   All FSEs to be newly constructed are subject to gravity grease
interceptor requirements and shall not qualify for a conditional waiver
unless exempt as specified in Subsection C.1.(c)(1).  Existing FSEs with
planned modifications having a building permit valuation of $100,000 or more
are also subject to gravity grease interceptor requirements and shall not
qualify for a conditional waiver unless exempt as specified in Subsection
C.1.(c)(1).



 



   (4)   Additional regulations regarding FSEs are specified in the
Board's Rules and Regulations. All food service establishments are required
to comply with these Rules and Regulations.



 



   (i)   Grease Interceptor Specifications.  All gravity grease
interceptors, hydromechanical grease interceptors and other grease removal
devices must meet the specifications as set forth in Section 94 of the City
of Los Angeles Plumbing Code.



 



   (ii)   Conditional Waiver from Gravity Grease Interceptor
Installation Requirements.  Under the sole discretion of the Director, an
FSE determined to have no immediate adverse impact on the POTW may be granted
a conditional waiver from gravity grease interceptor installation
requirements.  The Director may, at any time, revoke this conditional waiver
and require the FSE to install a gravity grease interceptor.



 



   (iii)   Variance to Allow Alternative Grease Removal Devices
(GRD).  If an FSE can demonstrate that installation of a grease interceptor
is not feasible due to space constraints or other considerations, the
Director may issue a variance from grease interceptor requirements and
authorize the installation of alternative grease removal devices. 
Alternative grease removal devices include, but are not limited to, devices
that are used to trap, separate and hold grease from wastewater and prevent
it from being discharged into the POTW.  All alternative grease removal
devices must be approved by the Director, on a case-by-case basis.  The FSE
must also demonstrate that BMPs have been implemented.



 



   2.   Reporting Requirements.



 



   (a)   Federal Reporting Requirements and Additional Reporting
Requirements.  Notwithstanding the reporting requirements set forth in 40
CFR Part 403, including, but not limited to, the requirements as set forth in
40 CFR §403.12, the Director may impose additional reporting requirements by
permit or otherwise.



 



   (b)   Reporting by Dischargers Subject to NCPS.  Unless required
more frequently or otherwise specified by the Director, dischargers which are
subject to NCPS shall submit to the Director, semi-annually, a Periodic
Compliance Report which shall contain, at a minimum, the information required
by 40 CFR § 403.12(e)(1).  The Director may require a discharger to submit
such reports on a more frequent basis and may base such decision upon the
amount of discharge or other site-specific concerns the Director may have
pertaining to the discharge.  In addition, dischargers that are subject to
NCPS shall submit Baseline Monitoring Reports (BMRs), Compliance Schedule
Progress Reports and Reports on Compliance with NCPS deadlines in accordance
with the General Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of
Pollution (Title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, Part 403.12).



 



   (c)   Reporting by SIUs not Subject To NCPS.  Unless required more
frequently by the Director, dischargers which are Significant Industrial
Users but are not subject to NCPS shall submit to the Director semi-annually
a report indicating the nature, concentration and flow of pollutants in the
effluent which are required to be reported by the Director.  At a minimum,
the report shall contain the information required by 40 CFR § 403.12(h).



 



   (d)   Production Data.  The Director may require any discharger to
submit production data.  At a minimum, dischargers subject to equivalent
mass or concentration limits or subject to production-based NCPS shall report
production data as follows:



 



   (1)   Dischargers subject to NCPS in which equivalent mass or
concentration limits are established by the Director in accordance with 40
CFR § 403.6(c)(1) shall report a reasonable measure of long term production
rate (based upon the criteria used for developing the discharger's effluent
limitations) in its Report on Compliance and its Periodic Compliance Reports,
as applicable.  In addition, such dischargers shall notify the Director in
accordance with Paragraph (e) of this subdivision after the discharger has a
reasonable basis to know that the production level will significantly change
within the next calendar month.



 



   (2)   All other dischargers subject to NCPS expressed in terms of
allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of
production) shall include information on the actual production during the
sampling period in its Report on Compliance and its Periodic Compliance
Reports, as applicable.



 



   (e)   Notification of Changed Discharge.



 



   (1)   All industrial dischargers shall provide written notification
to the Director before any planned change, including physical alterations or
additions to the permitted facility, production increases and anticipated
process changes which will result in a significant change in the volume or
character of pollutants to be discharged, including notification of changes
in the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the discharger has
submitted initial notification under 40 CFR § 403.12(p)(1).  Notice shall
be provided immediately before the change, except if such notice is not
feasible, the discharger shall provide the Director notice as soon as the
information becomes available.



 



   (2)   No wastewater discharge shall be commenced, without
notification to and approval by the Director, in which there has been a
significant change in the volume or characteristic which causes it to be
different from that expressly allowed under the permit issued.  Upon such
notification, the Director, in his/her discretion, may require that a new
application be filed and a new permit obtained before any wastewater
discharge involving the changed characteristic takes place.



 



   (f)   Signatory/Certification for Baseline Monitoring Reports,
Reports on Compliance, and Periodic Compliance Reports.  Baseline Monitoring
Reports, Reports on Compliance and Periodic Compliance Reports submitted by
dischargers subject to NCPS shall be signed by an authorized representative
of the discharger and shall contain the following certification:



 



   I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments
were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system
designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the
information submitted.  Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who
manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the
information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, true, accurate, and complete.  I am aware that there are significant
penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine
and imprisonment for knowing violations.



 



   (g)   Signatory/Certification for Other Reports.  The Director, at
his/her discretion, may require other reports or information submitted by
dischargers subject to NCPS, or any other discharger, to meet
signatory/certification requirements as the Director deems appropriate.



 



   (h)   Adoption of New City Specific Pollutant Limitations.  Within
180 days after promulgation of a new City Specific Pollutant Limitation and
notification thereof by the Board to specific dischargers affected thereby,
any discharger subject to such limitations shall submit to the Director a
report containing:



 



   (1)   The name and address of the discharger;



 



   (2)   The address or location of the premises where the discharge
does or will take place;



 



   (3)   The nature, average production rate, and Standard Industrial
Classification of the operations carried out by the discharger;



 



   (4)   The average and maximum flow of the discharge in gallons per
day;



 



   (5)   The nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge
from each regulated process and identification of applicable limitations. The
concentration shall be reported as a maximum or average as provided in
applicable limitations. If equivalent concentration limits have been
calculated in accordance with the limitation, this adjusted concentration
limit shall also be submitted;



 



   (6)   A statement, reviewed by an authorized representative and
certified under penalty of perjury by a person with primary responsibility
for the operation which contributes to the discharge, indicating whether the
limitations are being met, and, if not, what operation and maintenance
improvements or additional pretreatment is required for compliance;



 



   (7)   The shortest schedule under which any additional pretreatment
or operation and maintenance improvements required as a result of the new
limitations or requirements imposed pursuant to Paragraph (a) of Subdivision
1. of Subsection C. of this section will be completed.



 



   (i)   The completion date in such a schedule shall not be later than
the compliance date established for the applicable limitation.



 



   (ii)   The schedule shall provide for reporting increments of
progress in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major
events leading to the construction and operation of any additional
pretreatment necessary (e.g., hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and
final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing
construction, completing construction).



 



   (iii)   The discharger shall also submit a written progress report
to the Director, not later than 14 days following each increment of progress
date in the schedule and the final date for compliance. That report shall
state whether the discharger is in compliance with the scheduled increment of
progress. If compliance was not achieved, the report shall state the date by
which the discharger expects to comply with the scheduled increment of
progress, the reason for the failure to comply, and the steps being taken by
the discharger to maintain the established compliance schedule.



 



   (iv)   The time limit specified in this paragraph for operation or
maintenance improvements or additional pretreatment may be extended by the
Board.



 



   (i)   Reporting by SIUs Subject to BMPs.  Unless required more
frequently by the Director, dischargers which are SIUs subject to a BMP based
Categorical Pretreatment Standard, or other BMP based pollution prevention
alternative or local limit, shall submit to the Director, semi-annually,
documentation necessary to determine the compliance status of the discharger.



 



   (j)   Reporting by SIUs that Perform Monitoring.  Dischargers which
are SIUs subject to the reporting requirements in this section that monitor
any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location using the
procedures prescribed in subsection C.4.(d) of this section, the result(s) of
this monitoring shall be included in the periodic compliance report.



 



   (k)   Signatory / Certification Statement for Monitoring Waiver for
Pollutants Neither Present Nor Expected.  Upon approval of the monitoring
waiver and revision of a discharger's control mechanism by the Director, the
discharger must certify on each periodic compliance report submittal with the
statement below, that there has been no increase in the pollutant in its
wastestream due to activities of the discharger:  Based on my inquiry of the
person or persons directly responsible for managing compliance with the
Pretreatment Standard for 40 CFR [specify applicable National Pretreatment
Standard part(s)], I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and belief,
there has been no increase in the level of [list pollutant(s)] in the
wastewaters due to the activities at the facility since filing of the last
periodic compliance report.



 



   3.   Monitoring Facilities.  The Director may require to be
provided, operated and maintained at the discharger’s expense, separate and
secured monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow
measurement of the discharge. The monitoring facilities ordinarily shall be
situated on the discharger’s premises and in said event the Director shall
be granted total and unrestricted access thereto and use thereof by the
discharger as a condition of that discharger’s permit; however, at its
discretion the Board may allow monitoring facilities to be constructed
off-premises.



 



   4.   Monitoring and Sampling.



 



   (a)   Pre-Notification.  Any discharger may be required by the
Director, by permit or otherwise, to engage in periodic monitoring and
sampling of its discharge.  Where a discharger is required to monitor or
sample, the discharger shall notify the Director by telephone at least 48
hours in advance of any monitoring or sampling to be performed. 
Notification shall include the date, time and location of proposed monitoring
and sampling.  Monitoring and sampling shall be carried out during a period
of normal operations.  Prior to the commencement of any sampling or
monitoring, the Director may request that the discharger furnish to the
Director a split sample and all supporting data (i.e., methodology, flow
measuring data, strip chart recordings, and other pertinent information). 
The Director reserves the right to refuse any data developed from the
monitoring or sampling activity if the discharger fails to comply with the
pre-notification procedure.



 



   (b)   Notification of Discharge Violations and Resampling.  If
sampling performed by a discharger indicates a violation, the discharger
shall notify the Director within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
violation.  The discharger shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and
submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Director within 30 days
after becoming aware of the violation.  Where the Director has performed the
sampling and analysis in lieu of the discharger, the Director must perform
the repeat sampling and analysis unless it notifies the discharger of the
violation and requires the discharger to perform the repeat analysis. 
Re-sampling is not required if:



 



   (1)   The Director performs sampling at the discharger's facility at
a frequency of at least once per month, or



 



   (2)   The Director performs sampling at the discharger's facility
between the time when the initial sampling was conducted and the time the
discharger or the Director receives the results of this sampling.



 



   (c)   Representative Samples.  Samples must be taken during the
required monitoring period to ensure the data from the analysis of the
samples is representative of the conditions occurring at that time.  Samples
shall represent the normal wastewater flow to the POTW over a 24-hour
period.  Composite samples shall be collected according to time or flow as
specified by the Director, with at least one sample collected hourly.  The
Director may require grab samples or continuous monitoring as deemed
appropriate (e.g. pH and flow).  Samples may be collected either manually or
by automatic integrated sampling equipment approved by the Director.



 



   (d)   Sample Analysis.  The handling, storage, and analysis of all
samples taken for the determination of the characteristics of wastewater
discharged shall be performed by laboratories certified by the State of
California and shall be in accordance with the procedures established by the
EPA pursuant to Section 304(a) of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136,
as amended.  In the absence of a State certification process, the Director
may approve of a laboratory to perform any necessary sampling and analysis.



 



   (e)   Sampling Requirement.  Where the discharger is a SIU, the
discharger is to follow all sampling requirements as set forth in 40 CFR
403.12(g), unless the Director specifies otherwise.



 



   (f)   Waiver for Pollutants Neither Present Nor Expected.  The
Director may authorize a discharger subject to a Categorical Pretreatment
Standard to forego sampling of a pollutant regulated by a Categorical
Pretreatment Standard if the discharger has demonstrated through sampling and
other technical factors that the pollutant is neither present nor expected to
be present in the discharge, or is present only at background levels from
intake water and without any increase in the pollutant due to activities of
the discharger.



 



   5.   Inspection and Sampling.



 



   (a)   Inspections to Enforce Local, State, and Federal Laws. 
Whenever it is necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the
provisions of or perform any duty imposed by this section or other applicable
law, or whenever the Director has reasonable cause to believe that there
exists upon any premises any violation of the provisions of this section or
other applicable law, or any condition which makes such premises hazardous,
unsafe, or dangerous, the Director is hereby authorized to enter such
property at any reasonable time and to inspect the same and perform any duty
imposed upon the Director by this section or other applicable law provided
that:



 



   (1)   If the property is occupied, the Director shall first present
proper credentials to the occupant and request entry explaining the reasons
therefore and;



 



   (2)   If the property is unoccupied the Director shall first make a
reasonable effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or
control of the property and request entry, explaining the reasons
therefore.  If such entry is refused or cannot be obtained because the owner
or other person having charge or control of the property cannot be found
after due diligence, the Director shall have recourse to every remedy
provided by law to secure lawful entry and inspect the property.



 



   (b)   Inspections to Safeguard the Public Health or Safety. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Director has reasonable cause to
believe that wastewater discharge conditions on or emanating from the
premises are so hazardous, unsafe or dangerous as to require immediate
inspection to safeguard the public health or safety, the Director shall have
the right to immediately enter and inspect the property, and may use any
reasonable means required to effect such entry and make such inspection,
whether the property is occupied or unoccupied and whether or not formal
permission to inspect has been obtained. If the property is occupied, the
Director shall first present proper credentials to the occupant and demand
entry, explaining the reasons therefor and the purpose of the inspection.



 



   (c)   Penalty for Refusal to Permit Director to Make Inspections. 
No person shall fail or refuse, after proper demand has been made upon that
person as provided in Paragraph (b) of this Subdivision 5, to promptly permit
the Director to make any inspection provided for by said Paragraph (b). Any
person violating this subdivision shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.



 



   (d)   Consent and Agreement to Enter Premises.  The applicant, by
accepting any permit issued pursuant to this section, does thereby consent
and agree to the entry upon the premises, described in the permit, by
Department personnel for the following purposes as required by this section
or other applicable laws. The City shall be afforded access at all reasonable
times:



 



   (1)   for the purposes of inspection, sampling, flow measurement,
examination of records in the performance of other authorized duties;



 



   (2)   to set up on the discharger’s property such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling inspections, compliance-monitoring, flow
measuring or metering operations;



 



   (3)   to inspect and copy any records, reports, test results or
other information required to carry out the provisions of this section; and



 



   (4)   to photograph any waste, waste container, vehicle, waste
treatment process, discharge location, or violation discovered during an
inspection.



 



   (e)   Entry of Premises with Security Measures.  Where a discharger
has instituted security measures requiring proper identification and
clearance before entry onto the premises, the discharger shall make all
necessary arrangements with its security guards in order that, upon
presentation of such identification, City personnel shall be permitted to
enter the premises without delay for the purpose of performing their
authorized duties.



 



   6.   Public Access to Information.  Discharge and effluent data
provided to the City by the discharger shall be available to the public
without restriction. Other information may be subject to a claim of
confidentiality by the discharger. All information which is submitted to the
City by the discharger shall be available to the public, at least to the
extent provided by 40 CFR 2.302. With the exception of governmental agencies,
any person requesting this information from the City shall be required, prior
to the receipt of the requested information, to pay the reasonable cost of
said data gathering, reproduction and transmission incurred by the City.



 



   7.   Confidentiality.  All information, except for discharge and
effluent data, submitted to the City pursuant to this section may be claimed
by the discharger to be confidential. Any such claim must be asserted at the
time of submission of the information or data to the City. The claim may be
asserted by stamping the words “Confidential Business Information” on
each page containing such information or by other means, however, if no claim
is asserted at the time of submission, the City may make the information
available to the public without further notice. If such a claim is asserted,
the information will be treated in accordance with the procedures set forth
in 40 CFR Part 2 (Public Information).



 



   8.   Falsifying Information.  No person shall knowingly make any
false statement, representation or certification in any application, record,
report, plan or other document filed with the Director or required to be
maintained pursuant to this section, or tamper with or knowingly render
inaccurate any monitoring device required under this section.



 



   9.   Rules and Regulations.  The Board shall adopt rules and
regulations consistent with this section to effectuate its purpose and intent.



 



   10.   Retention of Records.  A discharger subject to the reporting
requirements established in this section (including documentation associated
with Best Management Practices) shall be required to retain for a minimum of
three years any records of monitoring activities and results (whether or not
such monitoring activities are required by this section), and shall make such
records available for inspection and copying by the Director.  This period
of retention shall be extended during the course of any unresolved litigation
regarding the discharger when requested by the Director.



 



   D.   Fees and Charges.



 



   1.   Purpose and Disposition.  It is the purpose of this subsection
to provide for the recovery of City costs associated with the discharge of
wastewater to the POTW.  All fees and money collected by the City pursuant
to the provisions of this section shall be deposited into the Sewer
Construction and Maintenance Fund established by Section 64.19.2 of this
Code.  Monies required hereunder to be deposited into that Fund shall be
expended for the purposes set forth in said section and to provide for any
appropriate refunds relative to such fees.



 



   2.   Application Fees.  (Amended by Ord. No. 182,076, Eff.
4/6/12.)  The Board shall require payment of an initial fee of $370 for each

   (c)   Class I SubClasses.  A Subclass of Class I described above
may be established by the Board to apply to certain groups of permittees
under Class I that qualify for reduced inspection and control services.  The
Board may group permittees for this purpose based on the amount and type of
discharges and based on the viability of implementing  Best Management
Practices as an effective control mechanism that merits reduced inspection
and control services.  Consequently, the annual fee will be a portion of the
Class I annual fee and in the amount proportional to the cost of inspection
and control services provided for that group of permittees and as specified
in Table I of the Board’s Rules and Regulations.



 



   (d)   I & C Fee Payment Schedule.  Each permittee, except the Class
I Subclass group, shall make quarterly payments in arrears on the first of
April, July, October or January, following the first permit anniversary date.



 



   (e)   Class I Subclass Fee Payment Schedule.  Permittees under the
Class I SubClass group shall commence making annual payments on the first of
April, July, October or January, following the first quarterly period in
which their permit becomes effective.



 



   4.   Quality Surcharge Fee.



 



   (a)   Quality Surcharge Fee Requirement.  The Sewer Service Charge
(SSC), as established under Sections 64.41 of the Code, recovers the cost of
treatment of domestic strength wastes discharged to the POTW for treatment. 
The SSC is paid by all of the users of the POTW.  However, industrial
wastewater discharged by Industrial Users (IUs) can vary significantly in
strength from that of domestic sewage.  Industrial wastewater strength can
be higher or lower than that of the domestic sewage.  A permittee whose
discharge is determined to contain BOD or SS, as defined in Subsection A. of
Section 64.00 of this Code, with concentrations in excess of the designated
BOD and SS values in the Board Rules and Regulations shall pay a quality
surcharge fee.



 



   (b)   Quality Surcharge Fee Determination.  A fee based on the
quality/strength of the Wastewater discharged into the POTW shall be paid
quarterly in arrears by all Industrial User or permittees in possession of a
valid Industrial Wastewater Permit where the Wastewater of said permittees is
found to be subject to the City's Quality Surcharge Fee and which is treated
in a City treatment plant. The permittee may choose to be billed for the
City's Quality Surcharge Fee based on either the provisions of Subsections
64.30 D.4.(b)(1) or 64.30 D.4.(b)(2) below.



 



   (1)   (Amended by Ord. No. 182,076, Eff. 4/6/12.)  Permittees whose
discharge is determined to contain BOD or SS, as defined in Subsection A. of
Section 64.00 of this Code, with concentrations in excess of the designated
BOD and SS values in the Board Rules and Regulations Governing Disposal of
Industrial Wastewater Into the Publicly Owned Treatment Works of the City of
Los Angeles shall pay a Quality Surcharge Fee (QSF) according to the
following formula and provisions.



 



   The Quality Surcharge Fee, for these permittees, shall be determined
pursuant to the following formula:



 



   C = V [a(SS-DSS) + b(BOD-DBOD)]k



 



   where:



 



   "C" is the Quality Surcharge Fee.



 



   "V" is the average daily volume of wastewater discharged in gallons and
shall be deemed: (1) the volume of water supplied to the premises, adjusted
as determined by the Board to account for water not discharged into the POTW;
(2) the metered volume of wastewater discharged into the POTW, in accordance
with a measuring device approved by the Board; or (3) a figure determined by
the Board, based upon any other equitable method.



 



   "SS" is the suspended solids as defined in Subdivision 75. of
Subsection A. of Section 64.00 of this Code, expressed in milligrams per
liter.



 



   "BOD" is the biochemical oxygen demand of the wastewater as defined in
Subdivision 6. of Subsection A. of Section 64.00 of this Code, expressed in
milligrams per liter.



 



   "DSS" is the suspended solids concentration designated by the Board in
the Board Rules and Regulations.



 



   "DBOD" is the biochemical oxygen demand concentration designated by the
Board in the Board Rules and Regulations.



 



   "a", is the verifiable cost assessed for each pound of suspended
solids, $0.365.



 



   "b", is the verifiable cost assessed for each pound of biochemical
oxygen demand, $0.363.



 



   "k", is (365 x 8.34)/1,000,000, a dimensional constant to convert C to
dollars.



 



   The values for "a" and "b" shall be annually adjusted as shown in the
table below:

   If the term containing SS or BOD is negative, a value of zero shall be
used for the term.



 



   (i)   In determining the amount of Quality Surcharge Fee to be paid
by various industrial users, the Board may establish industry-wide averages
for SS and BOD values.  The Board may group permittees into appropriate
discharge volume ranges each of which shall be represented by an average
discharge volume.  Where sampling and volume measurements of any permittee
are not practical for physical, economic or other reasons, these averages may
be used in establishing such permittee's Quality Surcharge Fee.



 



   (ii)   Any permittee whose fee has been determined in the above
manner who is not satisfied that the averages are applicable to its
discharge, may submit appropriate engineering data to the Board for its
consideration.  If the Board finds that such permittee's discharge differs
significantly from the averages established, it may determine the fee on a
more appropriate basis.



 



   (2)   Permittees whose discharge is determined to contain BOD or SS,
as defined in Subsection A. of Section 64.00 of this Code, with
concentrations less than the designated BOD and SS  values in the Board
Rules and Regulations may petition the Board to pay a Low-Strength SSC Rate
as defined in Section 64.41.01 (o), of the Code.  Upon qualification, such
permittee may be allowed to pay a Low-Strength SSC Rate where the
Low-Strength SSC Rate excludes the cost component associated with the
domestic sewage strength included in the SSC rate.  However, should such a
permittee petition and be allowed to pay a Low-Strength SSC Rate, such
permittee shall simultaneously become subject to the Zero-Based Quality
Surcharge Fee (QSF) as defined in Subsection 64.30 D.4.(c) below.  This fee
is to recover the treatment cost associated with removal of BOD and SS, as
defined below, in the permittee’s discharge.  This fee is also
representative of and a replacement for the strength cost component of the
Sewer Service Charge (SSC) not included in the Low-Strength SSC Rate as
defined in Section 64.41.01 (o) of the Code.



 



   The Quality Surcharge Fee, for these permittees, shall be determined
pursuant to the following formula:



 



   C  =  V [a(SS) + b(BOD)]k



 



   where:



 



   C, V, a, b, k, BOD and SS are defined under Section 64.30, Subsection
D.4.(b) above.



 



   (c)   Zero-Based Quality Surcharge Fee Qualifications and
Requirements.  Any discharger, in possession of a valid Industrial
Wastewater Permit, that petitions to pay a Low-Strength SSC Rate and a
Zero-Based QSF, shall meet the following qualifications and requirements:



 



   (1)   The discharger, if not in possession of a valid Industrial
Wastewater Permit, must apply for and obtain an industrial wastewater
discharge permit as defined under Subsection 64.30 C.1. of the Code.



 



   (2)   The permittee must petition, in writing, to the Board to be
placed on the Zero-Based Quality Surcharge Fee;



 



   (3)   The permittee must submit analytical data of its discharge, at
the time of and with its petition, to demonstrate that the strength of its
discharge does qualify for the Low-Strength SSC Rate;



 



   (4)   The permittee shall become subject to self monitoring of its
discharge, per Industrial Waste Management Division policies and also as
defined and established in Section 9 of the Board’s Rules and Regulations
and,



 



   (5)   The permittee shall install a sampling facility, for the
purposes of self-monitoring, in accordance to the requirements set forth by
the Director.



 



   5.   Private Septage Disposal Facility (PSDF) Fees.  Subject to the
provisions of this Subsection, all PSDFs shall pay, quarterly in arrears, the
following fees and discharge user rates:



 



   (a)   PSDF Inspection and Control Fee.  An annual Inspection and
Control (I & C) Fee, in the amount corresponding to the I and Classification
Number as set forth in Table 1 of the Board’s Rules and Regulations and;



 



   (b)   PSDF Septage Treatment Cost Recovery User Fee.  (Amended by
Ord. No. 182,076, Eff. 4/6/12.)  A per gallon Septage Treatment Cost
Recovery User fee at the rate of $0.0528 per gallon as applied to the
full-tank capacity of each vehicle discharging at the PSDF.  The rate shall
be annually adjusted as shown in the table below:

rainwater, construction water and seepage water-carried waste) to the POTW
shall pay a Temporary Facilities Usage Fee (TFUF) for temporary access to the
POTW based upon a share of the equity of the system for the disposal of
industrial wastewater.  The share of system equity included in the TFUF
shall be proportional to the flow, BOD and SS of the industrial wastewater
discharged into the POTW from the premises as compared with the total flow,
BOD and SS discharged by all system dischargers.  The TFUF rate shall be
based on the Sewage Facilities Charge in accordance with Section 64.11.3 of
the Los Angeles Municipal Code.

by this section and be payable for that quarter.  Any fees remaining unpaid
after the last day of the quarter shall be added and carried over to the
amount owing for the next quarter and become part of the fees owing for that
quarter. 



 



   (b)   Continued Delinquency.  All principal charges, excluding
accrued penalties, carried over from a prior quarter shall be assessed an
additional penalty in the amount of 2.5% if not paid on or before the last
day of each quarter until paid in full.  All charges carried over into the

must be paid.



 



   11.   Liability for Costs of Correction Arising from Unlawful
Discharge.  (Renumbered by Ord. No. 182,076, Eff. 4/6/12.)   Whenever any
discharger introduces or causes to be introduced wastewater in violation of
this section and such discharge, either singly or by interaction with other
discharges, results in damage to or is otherwise detrimental to or adversely
affects the POTW, said discharger shall be liable to the City for reasonable
costs necessary to correct that discharge, detriment or adverse effect,
including, but not limited to labor, material, inspection, transportation,
overhead, and incidental; expenses associated with the corrective action. The
discharger shall additionally be liable to the City for the reasonable costs
of investigation by the City arising from the unlawful discharge.



 



   E.   Enforcement



 



   1.   Notification of Violation.  When the Director finds that a
discharger has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
section, an Industrial Wastewater Permit, or order issued hereunder, or any
other Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, the Director may serve upon that
discharger a written Notice of Violation.  Within ten days of the receipt of
such notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory
correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions,
shall be submitted by the discharger to the Director.  Submission of such a
plan in no way relieves the discharger of liability for any violations
occurring before or after receipt of the Notice of Violation.  Nothing in
this section shall limit the authority of the Director to take any action,
including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first
issuing a Notice of Violation.



 



   2.   Administrative Orders.  When the Director finds that a
discharger has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this
section, or order issued hereunder, or any pretreatment standard or
requirement of the Industrial Wastewater Permit, the Director may issue an
Administrative Order to the discharger responsible for the discharge
directing that the discharger come into compliance.  If the discharger does
not come into compliance with the Administrative Order, the Director may
suspend and revoke the Industrial Wastewater Permit and request the Board to
disconnect or permanently block the discharger's connection and/or refer the
discharger to the City Attorney to seek Civil Penalties or Criminal
Prosecution, if such action is necessary to ensure permanent compliance.



 



   3.   Suspension of Industrial Wastewater Permit.



 



   (a)   Permit Suspension Criteria.  The Director may suspend an
Industrial Wastewater Permit when such a suspension is necessary in order to
collect payment of delinquent fees or stop a discharge which presents an
imminent hazard to the public health, safety or welfare, to the local
environment, or which either singly or by interaction with other discharges,
is an imminent hazard to the POTW or places the City in violation of its
NPDES permit.



 



   (b)   Discharger Response to Suspension Notification.  Any
discharger notified of a suspension of that discharger’s Industrial
Wastewater Permit shall immediately cease and desist the discharge of all
industrial wastewater into the POTW.  Any discharger notified of a
suspension of that discharger’s Industrial Wastewater Permit issued for a
private sewage disposal system shall immediately cease and desist the
discharge of industrial wastewater into both the private sewage disposal
system and the POTW.



 



   (c)   Failure of Discharger to Comply with a Suspension Order.  In
the event of a failure of a discharger to comply voluntarily with a
suspension order, the Board may take such steps as are reasonably necessary
to ensure compliance. These include, but are not limited to, immediate
blockage or disconnection of the discharger’s connection to the POTW, and a
request to the Department of Water and Power that it discontinue water
service of the affected property until full compliance with the Notice to
Comply has been achieved.



 



   (d)   Notice of an Intended Order of Suspension.  The Director in
the event of violation of this section, may serve the discharger with a
notice of an intended order of suspension, stating the reasons therefor, the
opportunity for a hearing with respect thereto, and the proposed effective
date of the intended order.



 



   (e)   Order of Suspension Board Hearing.  Any discharger whose
Industrial Wastewater Permit is suspended or served with a notice of an
intended order of suspension may file with the Executive Officer of the Board
a request for a Board hearing with respect thereto.  Filing of such request
shall not stay a suspension.  In the event a suspension of a permit due to
imminent hazard related to continued discharge, the discharger may request a
hearing, and the Board or a hearing examiner designated by the Board for that
purpose, shall conduct a hearing within three days of receipt of the
request.  In the event of hearing requests, for other than an imminent
hazard suspension, the Board shall hold a hearing on the suspension within 14
days of receipt of the request.  At the close of the hearing, the Board
shall make its determination whether to terminate, or conditionally terminate
the suspension imposed by the Director, or the Board may cause the permit to
be revoked.  Except in the case of a hearing within three days being
required as above provided, reasonable notice of the hearing shall be given
to the suspended discharger in the manner provided for in Subdivision 7. of
Subsection E. of this section.



 



   (f)   Stay of Order of Suspension.  In the event that the Board
fails to meet within the time set forth above or fails to make a
determination within 72 hours after the close of the hearing, the order of
suspension shall be stayed until a Board determination is made with respect
to the action of the Director.



 



   (g)   Reinstatement of Industrial Wastewater Permit.  The Director
shall reinstate the Industrial Wastewater Permit upon proof of compliance
which ends the emergency nature of the hazard created by the discharge that
had been cause for the Director to initiate the suspension, provided that the
Director is satisfied that all discharge requirements of this section, the
Board’s Rules and Regulations, and any Board order will be implemented.



 



   4.   Revocation of Industrial Wastewater Permit.  The Board may
revoke an Industrial Wastewater Permit upon a finding that the discharger has
violated any provision of this section or the Board's Rules and
Regulations.  No revocation shall be ordered until a notice and hearing on
the question has been held by the Board as provided in Subdivisions 6. and 7.
of this Subsection E. of Section 64.30.



 



   5.   Additional Emergency Remedial Measures.  The Director shall
have full power and authority to take any necessary precautions including but
not limited to, decontamination, sewer closure, packaging, diking, and
transportation of materials, in order to protect life, protect property, or
prevent further damage resulting from a condition that is likely to result in
a discharge which presents an imminent hazard to the public health, safety or
welfare; or which either singly or by interaction with other discharges, is
an imminent hazard to the POTW; or which places the City in violation of its
NPDES permit. In the pursuit of such an operation, City personnel, any party
contracting with the City, or duly authorized representative of another
governmental agency shall have immediate access to the premises. The Director
may prohibit approach to the scene of such emergency by any person vehicle,
vessel or thing, and all persons not actually employed in the extinguishment
of the condition or the preservation of lives and property in the vicinity
thereof.



 



   6.   Board Hearing.



 



   (a)   Appointment of Hearing Examiner.  With respect to permit
revocation or suspension hearings, the Board may conduct the hearing or may
appoint one or more examiners or designate one or more of its members to
serve as hearing examiners and to conduct a hearing with respect to any
appeal or protest filed. At such hearing the discharger may appear personally
or through counsel, cross-examine witnesses and present evidence in the
discharger’s behalf.



 



   (b)   Board Decision.  The hearing examiner or examiners, if other
than the Board, shall submit a written report and recommendations to the
Board together with a brief summary of the evidence considered and
conclusions reached with respect thereto. The Board, after considering
evidence presented at such a hearing, and any report submitted to it with
respect to such a hearing, or after any hearing which it conducts, shall
adopt findings supported by evidence, and may adopt, reject, or modify in
whole or in part, make its decision, and issue its order. If the Board’s
order is to revoke the discharger’s Industrial Wastewater Permit, the order
may be effective forthwith, or at a later specified date. The discharger
shall be notified in writing of the Board’s action.



 



   (c)   Compliance with Order of Revocation.  Any discharger whose
Industrial Wastewater Permit has been revoked shall immediately cease and
desist all discharge of any wastewater covered by the Permit. The Board may
disconnect or permanently block the discharger’s connection if such action
is necessary to ensure compliance with the order of revocation.



 



   (d)   Conditions for Resumption of Discharge after Permit
Revocation.  After revocation of a discharger’s Industrial Wastewater
Permit, there shall be no further discharge of industrial wastewater by that
discharger into the POTW unless there has been a new application filed, all
fees and charges that would be required upon an initial application and all
delinquent fees, charges, penalties and other sums owed by the discharger
and/or the applicant to the City have been paid to the City, and a new
Industrial Wastewater Permit has been issued. Any costs incurred by the City,
including administrative costs and investigative fees, in revoking the Permit
and disconnecting the connection if necessary, shall also be paid for by the
discharger before issuance of a new Industrial Wastewater Permit.



 



   7.   Notice.  Notice of the hearing shall be given to the
discharger at least ten (10) days prior to the date of hearing. Unless
otherwise provided herein, any notice required to be given by the Director
under this section shall be in writing and served in person or by registered
or certified mail addressed to the addressee’s last known address with
request for return receipt. Where no address is known, service may be made
upon the owner of record of the property upon which the alleged violation
occurred or by posting the notice conspicuously on the property.



 



   Notice shall be deemed to have been given at the time the written
notice is deposited, postage prepaid, in the United States mail at Los
Angeles, California.



 



   8.   Public Notice of Significant Noncompliant Industrial
Dischargers.  The Director shall identify a discharger as meeting one or
more of the Significant Noncompliance (SNC) criteria listed in 40 CFR Section
403.8(f)(2)(viii) and shall publish notice in a newspaper(s) of general
circulation that provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction(s)
served by the POTW.  The criteria for SNC shall be as follows:



 



   (a)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined
here as those in which 66% or more of all the measurements taken for the same
pollutant parameter taken during a six month period exceed (by any magnitude)
a numeric Pretreatment Standard or Requirement, including Instantaneous

Limits, multiplied by the applicable criteria (1.4 for BOD, TSS, fats, oils
and grease, and 1.2 for all other pollutants except pH);



 



   (c)   Any other violation of a Pretreatment Standard or Requirement
(Daily Maximum, long-term average, Instantaneous Limit or narrative standard)
that the Director determines has caused, alone or in combination with other
discharges, Interference or Pass Through, including endangering the health of
POTW personnel or the general public;



 



   (d)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent
endangerment to the public or to the environment, or has resulted in the
Director's exercise of its emergency authority to halt or prevent such a
discharge;



 



   (e)   Failure to meet, within 90 days of the scheduled date, a

operation or implementation of the local pretreatment program.



 



   9.   Penalties for Violations.



 



   (a)   Criminal Penalty.  Except as expressly provided, violation of
this section or any order issued by the Board or the Director as authorized
by this section is a misdemeanor punishable by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00
per violation per day or by imprisonment in the County jail for a period of
not more than six (6) months, or by both such fine and imprisonment.



 



   (b)   Injunctive Relief.  Whenever a discharger of wastewater is in
violation of this section or otherwise causes or threatens to cause a
condition of contamination, pollution or nuisance, the Board or the Director
may cause the City to seek a petition to the Superior Court for the issuance
of a preliminary or permanent injunction, restraining order, or other order,
as may be appropriate in restraining the continuance of such discharge.



 



   (c)   Civil Liability.  Any person who violates any provision of
this section or any term or condition of any permit issued pursuant to this

wastewater treatment administration, operations, maintenance, expense and
equipment expenditures, implementation and enforcement of the program
established herein.



 



   2.   Scope.  This section provides for the regulation of the
discharge of septage to the City’s P.O.T.W., through the issuance of
Septage Disposal Permits, enforcement of discharge prohibitions, designation
of discharge sites, requirements for waste tracking and load manifesting. 
This section further establishes fees for the recovery of all program costs.
Except as otherwise provided herein, the Director of the Bureau of Sanitation
(Director) under the jurisdiction of the Board of Public Works (Board) shall
administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this section. This
section applies to all Septage Haulers who discharge septage to the City’s
P.O.T.W.



 



   B.   Septage Disposal Rules and Regulations.  The Board shall adopt
Rules and Regulations consistent with the provisions of this section, to
effectuate its intent and purpose in regulating the discharge of septage to
the City’s P.O.T.W. and to administer the operations of any designated
discharge site. These Rules and Regulations shall be titled “RULES AND
REGULATIONS GOVERNING DISPOSAL OF SEPTAGE INTO THE P.O.T.W. OF THE CITY OF
LOS ANGELES”, herein referred to as the Board’s Septage Disposal Rules
and Regulations.



 



   C.   Septage Disposal Permit.  No person may discharge or cause to
be discharged any septage to the City’s P.O.T.W. without first obtaining a
Septage Disposal Permit in writing from the Director.  A separate Septage
Disposal Permit shall be required for each vehicle used to haul septage for

specifically approved as a designated discharge site.



 



   (d)   Discharge of septage consisting of materials mixed from
different types of septage is prohibited as specified under Section 5 of the
Board’s Septage Disposal Rules and Regulations.



 



   2.   Specific Pollutant Limitations.  Septage Haulers are subject
to specific pollutant limitations specified in Section 64.30, Subsection B.2.
of the Code for all loads discharged to the City’s P.O.T.W., except when
discharging domestic septage, other than portable toilet waste, to the
City’s P.O.T.W.



 



   E.   Septage Manifests.  As part of a septage tracking system, a
manifest, in a form prescribed by the Director, must be completed and
submitted by every Septage Hauler for each generator or source of septage to
be discharged to the City’s P.O.T.W.



 



   The manifest for each load being transported must be fully completed
and be available, in the transport vehicle, for inspection by the City
inspector at the time of discharge of such loads at the designated discharge
sites.  The manifest must be completed and submitted according to the
provisions of the Board’s Septage Disposal Rules and Regulations.



 



   F.   Industrial Wastewater Permit.Upon determination by the
Director, a generator of Industrial Wastewater or non-domestic septage, who
intends to discharge such wastes at a designated discharge site, may be
required to obtain an Industrial Wastewater Permit, per the requirements of
Section 64.30, Subsection C.1. of the Code.



 



   G.   Physical or Chemical Analysis. The Director may require
physical and chemical analysis of any septage hauled by any Septage Hauler
before permission is granted to discharge to the City’s P.O.T.W.  The
Director may also collect and analyze samples of septage to determine its
compliance with any applicable wastewater discharge pollutant limitations or
requirements.



 



   H.   Right to Reject.  The Director may reject septage from any
Septage Hauler if there is reason to believe that the septage may contain
hazardous waste, industrial waste or any other waste which may require a
chemical analysis to determine its quality and therefore acceptability for
discharge to the City’s P.O.T.W.



 



   I.   Discharge Sites.  The Board shall designate discharge sites
and may establish the hours of operation where properly permitted Septage
Haulers shall be allowed to discharge properly manifested septage.



 



   J.   Service Area.  Service Area shall mean the County of Los
Angeles. The City shall not accept any septage originating from outside the
County of Los Angeles unless specifically permitted by the Director as part
of the Septage Disposal Permit provisions.



 



   K.   Fees and Charges.  Septage Haulers shall pay all applicable
Septage Disposal Permit fees and charges established in this section. All
fees and charges collected from Septage Haulers shall be deposited in the
Sewer Construction and Maintenance Fund established by Section 64.19.2 of
this Code.  Monies collected are to be expended for the purposes set forth
in the above Subsection A1(e) and to provide for any appropriate refunds
relative to such fees.



 



   1.   Determination of Fees and Charges.  (Amended by Ord. No.
182,076, Eff. 4/6/12.)  When necessary, as determined by the Board, the
Board with the concurrence of the Office of the City Administrative Officer
shall propose an appropriate and revised schedule of fees and charges.  The
Board shall then transmit the schedule of fees and charges to the Mayor and
to the City Council for their approval and adoption.



 



   2.   Septage Disposal Permit Fee.  (Amended by Ord. No. 182,076,
Eff. 4/6/12.)  An Annual Septage Disposal Permit Fee of $2,500 is required
for each Septage Hauler vehicle that is permitted to discharge septage to the

   3.   Septage Treatment Cost Recovery User Fees.  (Amended by Ord.
No. 182,076, Eff. 4/6/12.)  The Septage Treatment Cost Recovery User Fee
rate established at Subsection D.5.(b) of Section 64.30 will be applied to
the full tank capacity of the Septage Hauler's vehicle, for each vehicle
permitted by the Director.



 



   4.   Emergency or Special Event User Fee.  (Amended by Ord. No.
182,076, Eff. 4/6/12.)  An Emergency or Special Event User Fee shall be
charged to any Septage Hauler requesting access to any designated septage
discharge site during non-business hours.  The amount of the fee will be
determined by the Director and will be equal to the City's costs to provide
such a service.  The fee shall recover all direct and indirect costs and
shall include, at a minimum, City costs equal to the overtime salary rate of
an Industrial Waste Inspector for three (3) hours.  The fee will be billed
to the Septage Hauler and will be charged in addition to the applicable user
fee rates imposed pursuant to the provisions of Subdivision (3) of this
Subsection.



 



   5.   Application of the Rates During an Emergency or Special
Event.  In the case of a major rain storm or earthquake, or other emergency
as determined by the Director, or during a Special Event, as declared by the
City Council, a Septage Hauler may discharge septage resulting from such
emergency or Special Event at a designated septage discharge site. The
Director shall screen such septage before it may be discharged to ensure that
such a discharge will not adversely affect the City’s P.O.T.W. or violate
any of the City’s “discharge limitations”. The Director shall bill the
Septage Hauler the appropriate User Fee according to Subdivision 3. of this
Subsection K.



 



   6.   Payment Method and Due Dates - Billing of Fees and Charges. 
Subject to the provisions of this subsection, all user fees and charges shall
be due in quarterly installments payable on the first day of January, April,
July and October, with each such payment applicable to the immediately
preceding quarter. This billing method will not be available to those Septage
Haulers that become delinquent with the payment of their fees and charges as
defined hereunder in Subdivision 7. of Subsection K. of this section. 
Delinquent Septage Haulers will no longer be invoiced, following the date on
which they become delinquent, and will be required to pay in guaranteed form,
prior to discharge, the payment required for the discharge of each load of
septage the Septage Hauler intends to discharge, in accordance with
Subdivision 8.(a) of Subsection K. of this section.



 



   7.   Delinquency - Additional Charge.  If the user fees are not
paid on or before the last day of the month in which they are due, the
Septage Hauler shall be deemed delinquent and will be issued a delinquent
notice by the Director. Additionally, a delinquency charge equal to ten
percent (10%) of the required user fees, but not less than $10.00, shall be
added to said user fees, and such additional charges shall become a part of
the user fees required by this section and be payable for said period.



 



   If the invoices for said user fees are not postmarked before the due
date, such user fees shall not become delinquent until 35 days following the
invoice mailing date, at which time, such user fees shall become delinquent
and the additional charges and time payment factors as provided above shall
apply.



 



   8.   Failure to pay user fee or charge.  Failure to pay any user
fee or charge payable under this section within 10 days after issuance of the
delinquent notice by the Director shall constitute grounds for the suspension
or revocation of the Permit(s) held by such Septage Hauler or for the
issuance of an order by the Director under the provisions of Section 64.31
F.  For purposes of this subsection, failure to pay includes a payment which
has been dishonored.



 



   (a)   Not withstanding any other provision in this Code:



 



   i.   Pending a final determination by the Director to suspend or
revoke a Septage Hauler’s permit(s) for failure to pay; or,



 



   ii.   Pending payment in full of all unpaid user fees or charges
pursuant to an agreement to pay such user fees or charges, any Septage Hauler
deemed delinquent under this subsection may, at the discretion of the
Director, discharge septage to the City’s P.O.T.W. on a load-by-load basis
on the condition that all user fees applicable for the load to be discharged
are paid prior to discharge.  All payments of applicable user fees and
charges under this subsection shall be by way of money order, cashiers check
or other guaranteed form of payment.



 



   (b)   Payments made under this subsection will be accepted during
normal business hours at one or more locations approved by the Director.



 



   (c)   The remedies provided by this section are cumulative to each
other and to all other remedies and penalties available to the City under
law.  This section shall not be construed to prevent the Director from
suspending or revoking any Septage Disposal Permit for any reason set forth
in Subsection F of this section.



 



   L.   Enforcement.  Violation of this Code, any term or condition of
a Septage Disposal Permit, the Board’s Rules and Regulations, or any order
issued by the Director, may subject the Septage Hauler to enforcement action
as provided herein.



 



   1.   Cause for Enforcement Action.  An enforcement action may be
initiated against a permittee for any of the following reasons:



 



   (a)   When a discharge, singly, or by interaction with other
discharges, may cause interference, pass through, or otherwise pose a
significant risk of causing the City to violate its NPDES wastewater Permit
requirements;



 



   (b)   When a discharger obtains its Septage Disposal Permit by
misrepresentation or fails to disclose fully all relevant facts in either the
Permit application or any report, including falsification of self-monitoring
reports or manifests or tampering with monitoring equipment;



 



   (c)   When a discharger fails to provide timely access to its
records;



 



   (d)   When a discharger fails to timely pay applicable fees;



 



   (e)   When a discharge, singly, or by interaction with other
discharges, may have an adverse effect on public health, safety or welfare;
on the P.O.T.W., its personnel, or on the environment;



 



   (f)   When a discharger exceeds effluent “discharge limitations”;



 



   (g)   When a discharger fails to provide a complete and accurate
Septage Manifest;



 



   (h)   When a discharger violates any term or condition of its
Septage Disposal Permit, this section, the Board’s Rules and Regulations,
or any order issued hereunder; and/or



 



   (i)   When the Director determines that a permittee has acted in any
manner inconsistent with the intent of this Code, the Septage Disposal Permit
or the laws governing the operation of the City’s P.O.T.W.



 



   Enforcement actions as provided herein may include any or all of the
following:



 



   2.   Notice of Violation.



 



   (a)   Scope of Notice of Violation.  The Director may serve upon a
Septage Hauler a written Notice of Violation.  The Notice of Violation may
require the Septage Hauler to promptly respond to the Director within a
specified time period and to identify the reason(s) and cause(s) for the
violation(s) and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention of
future violations.



 



   (b)   Effect of Notice of Violation.  Submission of the response by
a Septage Hauler to a Notice of Violation does not relieve the Septage Hauler
of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the
Notice of Violation.  Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of
the Director to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, whether or not a Notice of Violation has been issued.



 



   3.   Administrative Orders.



 



   (a)   Scope of Administrative Orders.  The Director may issue
Administrative Orders containing such terms and requirements as deemed
necessary by the Director for determining the compliance status of the
Septage Hauler; requiring the Septage Hauler to achieve compliance; and/or
suspending the Permit(s) and requiring the cessation of discharge in whole or
in part.



 



   (b)   Effect of Administrative Order.



 



   (1)   Failure of a Septage Hauler to comply with any condition or
requirement set forth in any Administrative Order issued hereunder is a
violation of this section and is independently enforceable for each day of a
violation.  An Administrative Order has the full force of law and is
enforceable in a court of law.  Administrative Orders shall become effective
and final upon issuance by the Director.



 



   (2)   A Septage Hauler’s compliance with the requirements of an
Administrative Order shall not relieve the Septage Hauler of liability for
any violation of a Septage Disposal Permit, this section, the Board’s Rules
and Regulations or other legally applicable requirements occurring before or
after receipt of the Administrative Order.



 



   (3)   Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the
Director to take any action, including emergency actions, or any other
enforcement action, whether or not an Administrative Order has been issued.



 



   (c)   Description of Administrative Orders.  Administrative orders
which the Director may issue include, but are not limited to, the following:



 



   (1)   Consent Orders.  The Director and discharger may enter into a
Consent Order establishing an agreement for achieving compliance with
discharger requirements. Consent Orders reflect the agreement of the Director
and discharger and are not appealable to the Board or otherwise subject to
administrative or judicial appeal.



 



   (2)   Cease and Desist Orders.  The Director may issue Cease and
Desist Orders requiring dischargers, among other things, to cease and desist
all such violations and directing the user to:



 



   (A)   Immediately comply with all Permit, Rules and Regulations and
Code requirements, and;



 



   (B)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be
needed to properly address a continuing or threatened violation, including
halting operations and/or terminating the discharge or preventing further
discharges.



 



   (3)   Compliance Orders.  The Director may issue Compliance Orders
requiring dischargers, among other things to:



 



   (A)   Comply with interim and/or final dates and steps for achieving
compliance;



 



   (B)   Submit and implement a plan of corrective actions to be taken
to maintain consistent and permanent compliance;



 



   (C)   Submit and implement a pollution prevention plan;



 



   (D)   Conduct additional self-monitoring; and/or



 



   (E)   Pay all delinquent fees and charges.



 



   (4)   Permit Suspension Order.  The Director may issue Permit
Suspension Orders suspending the right of the Septage Hauler to discharge
septage to the City’s P.O.T.W.  A Permit Suspension Order may be issued
due to the Septage Hauler’s failure to pay applicable fees or penalties or
for other good cause, including causes as specified in Subdivision 1 of this
Subsection L of this section.



 



   4.   Suspension of Septage Disposal Permit(s).



 



   (a)   Notice of Intended Permit Suspension Order.  The Director may
serve the Septage Hauler with a Notice of Intended Permit Suspension stating
the reasons therefor and the opportunity for a Show Cause Permit Suspension
Hearing before the Director with respect thereto.  After such hearing, the
Director shall make a final determination whether to issue the Permit
Suspension Order or take other enforcement action.  In cases where a Septage
Hauler holds multiple Septage Disposal Permits and upon determination by the
Director, the Permit Suspension Order may suspend all of the Septage
Hauler’s permits.



 



   (b)   Cessation of Discharge.  Any Septage Hauler notified of
suspension of its Septage Disposal Permit(s) shall immediately cease and
desist the discharge of all septage previously authorized by the Permit(s) to
the P.O.T.W.  It is unlawful for a Septage Hauler to continue to discharge
any septage to the P.O.T.W. after the Septage Hauler’s permit(s) has been
suspended.



 



   (c)   Reinstatement of Suspended Permit(s).  The Director shall
require that all deficiencies, violations and causes which led to the
suspension of the Septage Hauler’s permit(s), be removed and corrected
and/or require that the Septage Hauler pay all of the delinquent fees,
charges, penalties and other sums owed by the Septage Hauler to the City, or
reach an agreement with the Board to pay such fee and charges before a
suspended Permit is reinstated.  Suspension of the Permit(s) does not
relieve the Septage Hauler of its obligation to pay all applicable fees.



 



   (d)   Failure to Correct as Cause for Revocation.  Failure of the
Septage Hauler to take the necessary corrective actions and request
reinstatement of the suspended Permit(s) within ninety (90) days following
issuance of a Permit(s) Suspension Order shall be grounds for Permit(s)
revocation and service termination according to Subsection 5 of this section.



 



   5.   Revocation of Septage Disposal Permit(s).



 



   (a)   Notice of Intended Permit Revocation.  The Director, in the
event of:



 



   (i)   a violation of a Septage Disposal Permit, this Code, the
Board’s Rules and Regulations, any order issued hereunder; and/or



 



   (ii)   The Septage Hauler’s failure to pay applicable fees or
penalties; and/or



 



   (iii)   for other good cause (including causes as specified in
Paragraph (d) of Subdivision 4 of this subsection, may serve the Septage
Hauler with a Notice of Intended Permit Revocation, stating the reasons
therefore and the opportunity for a Show Cause Permit Revocation Hearing
before the Director with respect thereto.  After such hearing, the Director
shall make a final determination whether to revoke the Permit(s) or take
other enforcement action.  In cases where a Septage Hauler holds multiple
Septage Disposal Permits, the Director may revoke all of the Septage
Hauler’s permits.



 



   (b)   Cessation of Discharge.  Any Septage Hauler notified of the
revocation of its Permit(s) shall immediately cease and desist the discharge
of all septage previously authorized by the Permit(s) to the P.O.T.W. It is
unlawful for a Septage Hauler to continue to discharge any septage to the
P.O.T.W. after Permit(s) has been revoked.



 



   (c)   Issuance of New Septage Disposal Permit Subsequent to
Revocation.  After revocation of a Septage Hauler’s permit(s), there shall
be no further discharge of any septage by the Septage Hauler to the P.O.T.W.,
unless there has been a new application filed, all fees and charges that
would be required upon an initial application and all delinquent fees,
charges, penalties and other sums owed by the Septage Hauler and/or the
applicant to the City have been paid to the City, or the Septage Hauler has
reached an agreement with the Board to pay such charges and fees, and a new
Septage Disposal Permit has been issued.  Any costs incurred by the City,
including administrative costs and investigative fees, in revoking the
Septage Disposal Permit(s) shall also be paid for by the Septage Hauler
before issuance of new Septage Disposal Permit(s).



 



   6.   Appeals and Hearings.



 



   (a)   Appeals.  Upon the issuance of an Administrative Order or
notification of Permit revocation by the Director, a Septage Hauler may,
within 14 days from service of the Director’s order or notice, submit a
written request to the Secretary of the Board for a Board hearing to appeal
said order or notice.



 



   The filing of said appeal does not act to stay any enforcement action
or time set for compliance nor does said filing of an appeal in any way
relieve the Septage Hauler from any liability or responsibility for the
violation which is the subject of the appeal.  Nothing in this section shall
act to limit the authority of the Director to take any action, including
emergency actions or any other enforcement actions, whether or not a request
for appeal has been made.  Failure of the Septage Hauler to request a
hearing within the specified time or failure to pay any required filing fees
shall be deemed a waiver of request for such a hearing.



 



   In the event of a hearing request to consider an Administrative Order
or notification of Permit Revocation as determined by the Director, the
Board, or a hearing examiner designated by the Board for that purpose, upon
written request by the Septage Hauler, shall conduct the hearing to consider
the appeal of said order or notice within a reasonable period of time with
consideration shown for the convenience and necessity of all parties and
their representatives.



 



   (b)   Hearings.



 



   (1)   At the hearing the Director shall submit, for the record,
evidence to support the issuance of the Administrative Order or notification
of Permit Revocation which is the subject of the appeal.  The Septage Hauler
shall have the opportunity prior to the hearing to examine the evidence to be
submitted by the Director.  The Septage Hauler or counsel should be present
at the hearing and will be given the opportunity to present any relevant
evidence or witnesses, and ask questions or make comments concerning the
Director’s evidence and testimony.  Failure of the Septage Hauler or the
Septage Hauler’s representative to appear at the hearing after receiving
notice of the hearing shall be deemed a waiver of hearing rights.



 



   (2)   At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall make
findings and determine whether the evidence presented at the hearing supports
the issuance of the Administrative Order or notification of Permit Revocation
which is the subject of the appeal.



 



   (c)   Notification.  Only those persons who request a hearing need
be notified of the date and time of the hearing.  The Board Secretary shall
make said notification at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the
hearing by certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested, to the
address as shown on the hearing request.



 



   (d)   Continuances.  The Board may grant continuances; however when
a hearing examiner has been assigned to such hearing, no continuances may be
granted except by that hearing examiner, for good cause shown, so long as the
matter remains before the hearing examiner.



 



   (e)   Reporting.  The proceedings at the hearing shall be reported
by an electronic recording if requested by any party thereto.  A transcript
of the proceedings shall be made available to all parties upon request and
upon payment of the prescribed fee therefor.



 



   (f)   Oaths-Certification.  In any proceedings under this division,
the Board, any Board member, the secretary of the Board or the hearing
examiner has the power to administer oaths and affirmations and to certify to
official acts.



 



   (g)   Appointment of Hearing Examiner(s).  Whenever an appeal or
protest is made to the Board pursuant to this section, the Board may appoint
one or more hearing examiners or designate one or more of its members to
serve as hearing examiners, and direct such hearing examiner or examiners to
consider all or part of such appeal or protest or to conduct all or part of
such hearing and to submit a report or reports thereon as hereafter provided.
Hearing examiners may, be appointed from among the officers or employees of
the City.



 



   (h)   Report of Hearing Examiner.  Within such period as may be
fixed by the Board, the hearing examiner shall submit a written report to the
Board.  Such report shall contain a brief summary of the evidence considered
and shall state the hearing examiner’s conclusions and recommendations, and
if the matter is then ready for decision, the report shall contain a proposed
decision, in such form that it may be adopted by the Board as its decision in
the case, and a brief statement of the hearing examiner’s reasons
therefor.  All hearing examiner’s reports shall be filed by the secretary
of the Board as public records.  A copy of each proposed decision so filed
shall then be mailed by the Secretary of the Board to each party.



 



   (i)   Consideration of Report by Board.  The Board shall fix a time
when the Board will consider the report of the hearing examiner.  Notice
thereof shall be mailed by the Board Secretary to each party not less than
ten (10) days prior to the date fixed, unless otherwise stipulated. Not later
than five (5) days before such date any party may file written exceptions to
any part or all of the hearing examiner’s report.



 



   (j)   Disposition by Board.



 



   (1)   After considering the hearing examiner’s report and any
exceptions, proposals, and arguments submitted, the Board may adopt, reject,
or modify such report in whole or in part.  If the matter is then ready for
decision, the Board may proceed to make its decision.



 



   (2)   If the Board does not decide the matter upon the hearing
examiner’s report, the Board may itself consider the matter either in whole
or in part, upon the record, including the transcript, or may decide the
matter after itself receiving the whole or any part of the evidence or may
refer part or all of the matter to the same or another hearing examiner.  If
part of the matter is so referred to an hearing examiner, such hearing
examiner shall prepare and submit to the Board a report, including a proposed
decision as provided in this section, upon the evidence heard by such hearing
examiner, and the papers, records, and reports which are part of the record
of the prior hearing, and thereafter the matter shall proceed as heretofore
provided in the case of an original hearing examiner’s report.  If
additional evidence is received by the Board itself, no member thereof may
vote on the matter unless the member has heard the additional testimony or
has read a reporter’s transcript of the same, or if there was other
additional evidence, unless the member has considered such other additional
evidence.  The Board shall give such notice of its decision as is provided
or required in cases where it makes no reference to a hearing examiner.



 



   (k)   Duty to Exhaust Administrative Remedies.  A Septage Hauler
has the legal obligation to exhaust administrative remedies.  Failure of a
Septage Hauler to pursue its appeal rights hereunder or to appeal the
Director’s decision is a waiver of such rights.  Accordingly, any action
of the Director which was subject to review by the Board under this
subdivision, but was not appealed to the Board, shall not be subject to
judicial review in any civil proceeding.



 



   7.   Judicial Enforcement Remedies.



 



   (a)   Injunctive Relief.  Whenever a Septage Hauler has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of a Septage Disposal Permit, this
section, Board’s Rules and Regulations or any order issued hereunder, the
Director, through the City Attorney, may petition the Superior Court for the
issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as may be appropriate, which
restrains or compels the specific performance of the order or other standard
or requirement imposed by this section on activities of the Septage Hauler. 
The Director may also seek such other relief as may be appropriate including
a requirement for the Septage Hauler to conduct environmental remediation. 
The petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against or a
prerequisite for taking any other action against a Septage Hauler.



 



   (b)   Civil Liability.  Pursuant to Section 54740 of the Government
Code, any person who violates conditions of a Septage Disposal Permit, this
section, the Board’s Rules and Regulations, any order issued hereunder, or
any other provision as identified in Section 54739(a) of the Government Code,
may be civilly liable in a sum of not to exceed twenty-five thousand dollars
($25,000) a day for each violation.  The local agency may petition the
superior court to impose, assess, and recover such sums.



 



   Remedies under this section are in addition to and do not supersede or
limit any and all other remedies, civil or criminal, but no liability shall
be recoverable under this section for any violation for which liability is
recovered under Subdivision 8 of this section.



 



   (c)   Criminal Liability.  It shall be unlawful for any person to
violate any condition of a Septage Disposal Permit, this section, the
Board’s Rules and Regulations, or any order issued hereunder.  Any person
violating any of the provisions or failing to comply with any of the
mandatory requirements of this Code, the Board’s Rules and Regulations or,
any order issued by the Director pursuant to this Code shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor and said violation shall be punishable by a fine of not more than
$1,000.00 for each offense or by imprisonment in the County Jail for a period
of not more than six (6) months, or by both such fine and imprisonment.



 



   Each person shall be guilty of a separate offense for each and every
day during any portion of which any violation of a Septage Disposal Permit,
this Code the Board’s Rules and Regulations, or any order issued hereunder,
by such person, and each such violation shall be punishable accordingly. 
Nothing in this Code shall prohibit the payment of investigative costs by any
person so convicted of violating any of the mandatory requirements of this
Code, the Board’s Rules and Regulation or, any order issued by the Director
pursuant to this Code, to the Bureau of Sanitation, to reimburse said agency
for all costs expended to investigate and/or enforce the requirements of this
Code, the Board’s Rules and Regulations or, any order issued by the
Director pursuant to this Code.

determined rainy season is incomplete or nonexistent.



 



(Amended by Ord. No. 172,763, Eff. 9/19/99.) 



 



   (2)   For Commercial, Governmental, Multiple Dwelling, and
Industrial users, the volume shall be the volume of water supplied to the
premises during the billing period multiplied by the Default Percentage
Discharge.  The Board shall annually adjust the Default Percentage Discharge
based, in whole or in part, on Department of Water and Power Water
conservation policies, to reflect the amount of flow discharged to the sewer
system by commercial, governmental, multiple dwelling, and industrial users,
but in no event shall the Default Percentage Discharge be less than 90% or
exceed 94%.  (Amended by Ord. No. 182,076, Eff. 4/6/12.)



 



   (3)   Direct Measurement/Calculation:



 



   A.   In lieu of paragraphs (1) or (2) above, the Board may authorize
the direct measurement or calculation of the volume of sewage discharged from
a premises in the following circumstances:



 



   i.   Where in the Board’s judgement, the flows of sewage from the
premises are sufficient for accurate measurement, any user may obtain a
permit from the Board and install a device or devices approved by the Board
to measure all the sewage discharged into the sewer system from the
premises.  For purposes of this article, the total aggregate sewage measured
through said device or devices sharing a given billing period will be deemed
to be the sewage volume discharged from the premises for said billing period.



 



   ii.   Where the plumbing on a premises has been arranged to isolate
the plumbing which serves uses that are tributary to the sewer from the uses
not so tributary, subject to inspection and approval by the Department of
Building and Safety (DBS), a user may obtain Board authority to install one
private water meter for each tributary City water meter serving the
premises.  When the private meter is installed on the tributary service, the
Sewer Service Charge shall be billed based on the volume of water through the
private meter during the billing period.  When the private meter is
installed on the non-tributary service, the Sewer Service Charge shall be
billed based on the difference between the volume through the City meter and
the private meter during the billing period.  A user may allow hose bibbs to
remain attached to the tributary service, but no credit against the Sewer
Service Charge shall be given in such a case.  The Board shall promulgate
rules which determine whether the meter is to be installed on the tributary
or non-tributary service.



 



   A user may choose at any time to revert to volume determination based
on the methods in Paragraphs (1) or (2) above, whichever is applicable;
however, such a user may not again be approved for private metering before 12
months have elapsed since the effective date of reversion.



 



   The Board may require the user at any time to install a device to
telemeter the data obtained by the metering device back to a City computer if
the installed meter allows for this to be done.



 



   B.   Whenever the Board has authorized the direct measurement or
calculation of sewage volume discharged from a premises, the user shall bear
all responsibility for the expense of permits, equipment, installation, and
maintenance of any private water meter.  The Board may require periodic
testing of installed equipment to insure reasonable accuracy.  The board may
revert a user who does not repair malfunctioning equipment within the time
which the Board may specify to volume determination based on the methods in
paragraphs (1) or (2)  above, whichever is applicable.



 



   (h)   Low-Income Subsidy:  The Sewer Service Charge shall be
reduced by 31% for low-income Residential users who pay such charges, the
definition of such a class being determined by the Board of Water and Power
Commissioners, subject to verification by the Director of Sanitation, for the
first 18 billing units (a billing unit being each hcf of sewage entering the
sewer system) of each two-month billing period, or the first nine billing
units for each one-month billing period as to any such Residential user
billed monthly.  (Amended by Ord. No. 182,076, Eff. 4/6/12.)



 



   (i)   Low-Income Subsidy Surcharge:  The Sewer Service Charge to
all users, who are not within the class of a low-income Residential user, as
provided in Subsection (h), shall be increased by a surcharge of 0.84%.



 



   (j)   The sewer service charge for the volume of sewage introduced
into the sewer system from any property not supplied with water by Water and
Power will be determined by the Board and shall be as nearly as possible
equivalent to the sewer service charge established under this section for
similar property supplied with water from Water and Power.



 



   (k)   The Board shall have the power and duty, and is hereby
directed to enforce all of the provisions of this article, except as
otherwise set forth herein, and shall provide such rules and regulations as
are consistent with the provisions of this article and as may be necessary or
desirable to aid in the administration, including adjustments. and
enforcement of the sewer service charge.



 



   (l)   The Board or any of its authorized representatives may make
such inspections or investigations as said Board deems necessary at any
reasonable time in any building, premises or lot for any of the purposes set
forth in this article. No person shall interfere with, prevent or refuse to
permit the entry of said Board or any of its authorized representatives into
or upon any building, premises or lot for any of the purposes set forth in
this article.



 



   (1)   To determine the size, depth and location of the sewer or
storm drain connection;



 



   (2)   To determine the outlet of an sewer or storm drain connection
by depositing testing materials in any plumbing fixture attached thereto and
flushing the same, if necessary;



 



   (3)   To determine by measurements and samples the quantity of
sewage or waste water being discharged into any sewer, storm drain or water
course;



 



   (4)   To inspect, test and sample the discharge of any device used
to prevent the discharge into any sewer, storm drain, or water course of
illegal waste or illegal quantities of waste, such as floor drains, sand
boxes, grease traps or other clarifiers, also, of those devices used to
grind, shred, pulverize, or otherwise treat garbage or industrial waste
before discharging same into a sewer or storm drain.



 



   (5)   To determine the location of roof, swimming pool and surface
drains, and whether they are connected to a street gutter, storm drain or
sewer.



 



   (6)   To determine the nature and quantity of flow in any open water
course or storm drain.

   (Amended by Ord. No. 173, 587, Eff. 12/7/00.)



 



   (a)   The collection of the sewer service charge imposed by this
article shall be under the direction. supervision and control of the Office
of Finance.



 



   (b)   The Office of Finance and City Controller, and the deputies of
each of them, shall have the power to audit and examine all books and records
as may be necessary for the purpose of ascertaining the amount of sewer
service charges required to be paid according to the provisions of this
article, and for the purpose of verifying the statements or any item thereof
filed pursuant hereto. Each person, individual, corporate or otherwise whose
duty it is to remit to or to collect and remit to the City of Los Angeles any
sewer service charge imposed by this article shall keep and preserve for a
period of four (4) years all books and records as may be necessary for the
purpose hereof.



 



   (c)   (Amended by Ord. No. 171,497, Eff. 3/7/97.)  The Office of
Finance shall arrange for the billing and collection of, and accounting for
the Sewer Service Charge through and by available facilities of Water and
Power insofar as possible and, with the advice and assistance of the Director
of the Office of Administrative and Research Services (Amended by Ord. No.
173,363, Eff. 7/29/00, Oper. 7/1/00.), shall arrange for the payment to Water
and Power of its costs of such services, and to the extent such billing and
collection by Water and Power are not deemed possible or practical by the
Office of Finance due to adjustments or otherwise, separate billing and
collection at reasonable and regular intervals shall be provided for by the
Office of Finance.



 



   For those industrial users that pay a low-strength sewer service charge
rate, the Bureau of Sanitation shall calculate the amount to be billed for
the strength cost component of the Sewer Service Charge, as “Zero-Based”
Quality Surcharge Fee, and the Bureau of accounting shall perform the billing
and collection of, and accounting for said fee.



 



   (d)   The Office of Finance shall have the power and duty, and is
hereby directed, to enforce all of the provisions of this section, and may
make such rules and regulations as are consistent with the provisions of this
article as may be necessary or desirable to aid in the administration and
enforcement of the provisions of this article.



 



   (e)   The duty to collect the sewer service charge from a user or
other person billed by Water and Power as provided for in this article, shall
commence with the beginning of the first regular billing period of Water and
Power applicable to said user or other person billed which starts on or after
the operative date of this ordinance.  (Amended by Ord. No. 162,637, Eff. 
8/23/87.)



 



   (f)   The sewer service charge shall be billed to and paid by said
user or other person in whose name or names the water meter or meters serving
said premises is listed upon the records of Water and Power, or, in the
absence of such listing, as may be determined by the Board provided however
the owner of said premises shall also be liable, jointly and severally, for
any unpaid charges. (Amended by Ord. No. 162,865, Eff. 11/22/87.)



 



   (g)   (Amended by Ord. No. 171,531, Eff. 4/5/97, Oper. 7/1/97.) 
Unless the billing is handled through some other procedure the sewer service
charge shall be billed by Water and Power in accordance with its regular
billing practices, shall be added to and included on each water bill of Water
and Power to users of the sewer system, and shall be due and payable to the
City of Los Angeles through Water and Power at the time and in the manner of
the payment of said water bill and other charges made thereon. If any
increase in the sewer service charge, as a result of an amendment to Section
64.41.03 of this Code, is effective during a particular user’s billing
period, said user will be billed at such new rate for the period of time
during such billing period said new rate is in effect and at the old rate for
the period of time prior to that. For the purpose of such proration the water
delivered or furnished to the premises, or the sewage discharged from the
premises pursuant to Section 64.41.03 of this Code, will likewise be prorated
based on the respective number of days during such billing period the new and
old rate are in effect.



 



   (h)   Where Water and Power does not supply, deliver to, or connect,
any of its water lines to a premise in the City of Los Angeles from which
premise the sewer system receives sewage, and said user is determined by the
Board to be a user of the City’s sewer system, the user shall be billed
separately by the Office of Finance. (Amended by Ord. No. 151,211, Eff.
8/7/78.)



 



   (i)   All bills for the sewer service charge provided for herein are
due and payable upon presentation. Bills not paid within fifteen (15) days
after date of presentation shall be deemed delinquent.



 



   (j)   (Amended by Ord. No. 171,531, Eff. 4/5/97, Oper. 7/1/97.) 
Whenever the Office of Finance determines that a user or other person billed
as provided for in this article has deliberately withheld or failed or
refused to pay all or any part or portion of the sewer service charge billed
to him by Water and Power, and the Office of Finance deems it in the best
interest of the City, the Office of Finance may relieve the Water and Power
of any obligation it may have to bill or collect, or both, the sewer service
charge from said user or person billed, and assume the billing or collection,
or both, thereof for the periods involved.



 



   If the Office of Finance for whatever reason assumes from Water and
Power the direct billing or collection, or both, of the sewer service charge,
he may at said time so notify the person billed and, in addition, the owner
of the premises, if other than the person billed, of the delinquency, if such
be the case.



 



   Whenever the Office of Finance determines that a user or other person
billed initially by him has deliberately withheld or failed or refused to pay
all or any part or portion of the sewer service charge billed, and the Office
of Finance deems it in the best interest of the City, the Office of Finance
may serve notice on the user or other person billed and, in addition, the
owner of the premises, if other than the person billed, of his or her
delinquency.



 



   The notice in either event shall be served on the user or other person
billed and, in addition, the owner of the premises, if other than the person
billed, by handing it to him or her personally, or by deposit of the notice
in the United States mail, postage prepaid thereon, addressed to the user or
other person, at the address to which billing was made by Water and Power,
or, if his or her address has been changed or he or she was not so billed
then to his or her last known address and, in addition, the owner of the
premises, if other than the person billed, at such owner’s address. The
notice shall include information as to the amount due and a warning notice
that if the amount due is not paid within fifteen (15) days, proceedings to
establish a lien against the real property to which the service was furnished
will be instituted, and if the lien is established and recorded, penalties
and interest, pursuant to this article, will accrue. If the user or person
billed or, in addition, the owner of the premises, if other than the person
billed, fails to pay the Office of Finance within fifteen (15) days from the
date of service of the notice upon such person, which shall be the date of
mailing if service is not accomplished in person, the Office of Finance is
authorized to make such delinquent charges a lien against any such property
(except that no such lien shall be created against any publicly owned
property). Such lien proceedings will be initiated by the Office of Finance
by preparing a list of such delinquencies containing the names, the amount
due, and the description of each parcel to be subjected to the lien
procedure. The descriptions of the parcel shall be hose used for the same
parcels on the Assessor’s map books for the current year. The Office of
Finance shall fix a time, date and place for hearing any protests or
objections to the list, and shall cause notice of the hearing to be mailed to
each owner of the parcels of real properly to be subjected to the lien not
less than ten (10) days prior to the date of hearing. Any person opposing the
lien upon real property which is owned by such person may submit his or her
protest either in writing, orally, or both. The oral hearing may be continued
from time-to-time as schedules require. The Office of Finance shall keep a
record of the notices, the persons to whom such notices were mailed, the date
of mailing, and the person responsible for the mailing. A declaration by the
person responsible for such mailing that it was made shall be sufficient
evidence that notice was given. At the hearing on the list of the Office of
Finance for imposition of the lien the list shall be prima facie evidence of
he matters contained therein. The burden of going forward with the evidence
to establish the incorrectness of the list shall be upon the person opposing
the proposed lien. Upon a conclusion of the hearing, the Office of Finance
shall confirm and verify the list to be recorded in the County Recorder’s
Office. The lien as to each parcel properly described in such list shall
carry a basic penalty of ten percent (10%) of the amount owed or an
administrative expense of fifty dollars ($50.00), whichever is higher,
together with an additional penalty at a rate of one percent (1%) per full
month compounded monthly from the date of recordation of the lien on all
charges due. Such lien shall have the same force, effect, priority and
duration as to the real properly described as would the lien of an abstract
of judgment against the owner of real property at the time such list is
recorded and may be enforced in like manner.



 



   Property may be discharged from the lien by the payment of all
delinquent charges plus penalties. A list of all such delinquent charges
shall be recorded at least every six months, but no delay or informality in
recording the same shall invalidate the lien or any unpaid charge or any
subsequent act or proceeding. If through error or otherwise the amount of any
unpaid charge plus penalties thereon as stated in said list shall be
incorrect, said error shall be disregarded and shall not affect or invalidate
the filing if said error is one dollar ($1.00) or less.



 



   The Director shall provide such information, as necessary, to the
Office of Finance in reference to property descriptions and owners.



 



   (k)   The sewer service charge shall be a civil debt owing to the
City of Los Angeles from the user of any premises from which sewage is
received or collected into the sewer system, or from any other person billed
as provided in this section. Any person owing money to the City under the
provisions of this article shall be liable in an action brought in the name
of the City of Los Angeles in any court of competent jurisdiction for the
recovery of such amount and any penalty imposed thereon pursuant to the terms
of this article. In any such action reasonable attorney’s fees shall be
awarded to the City of Los Angeles. (Last Sentence added by Ord. No. 162,637,
Eff. 8/23/87.)



 



   (l)   If the Office of Finance finds that he cannot collect the
sewer service charge and penalty or either of them imposed under the terms of
this article, or that his efforts to collect any such amount would be
disproportionately costly with relation to the probable outcome of the
collection efforts, he may prepare a report setting forth his finding and the
reasons therefor, and submit it to a Board of Review which shall be composed
of the City Controller, the Office of Finance, and the City Attorney, or the
duly appointed representative of each. The Board of Review may call for
additional evidence as it may deem relevant. Upon unanimous approval of a
finding by the Board of Review, the Office of Finance may remove from his
active accounts receivable said unpaid sewer service charge and penalty. If
the Board of Review does not unanimously recommend approval of the finding,
the matter shall be returned to the Office of Finance. The Office of Finance
may include in a single report his findings and supporting reasons regarding
the sewer service charge and penalty due from more than one user or person
billed. The removal from the active accounts receivable of the Office of
Finance of any unpaid sewer service charge and penalty as provided for by
this article shall not preclude the City from collecting or attempting to
collect any such sewer service charge and penalty.



 



   (m)   The Office of Finance for and in the name of the City of Los
Angeles may enter into a written agreement in form approved by the City
Attorney, with any person indebted to The City of Los Angeles pursuant to the
terms of this article obligating said person to pay such indebtedness to the
Office of Finance in monthly or more frequent installments, but in no event
over a period greater than one year. In any such agreement such person,
whether corporate, individual or otherwise, shall acknowledge the obligation
owed to the City and his indebtedness thereon, shall agree that in the event
of his failure to make timely payment of any installment thereof that the
whole amount then due and unpaid may be determined by the Office of Finance
to be immediately due and payable in full, and shall agree to pay all costs
and reasonable attorneys fees incurred by or on behalf of the City in
collection thereof or for any legal proceeding commenced for said purpose.



 



   (n)   Whenever a payment mailed to the City is received after the
time prescribed in this article for receipt thereof, the Office of Finance or
Water and Power as the case may be, may accept proof that there had been a
timely deposit thereof in the United States mail and that no delinquency or
penalty is applicable thereto.



 



   (o)   Whenever the amount of a sewer service charge and penalty, or
either, is determined by Water and Power or by the Office of Finance to have
been overpaid, paid more than once, or to have been erroneously collected or
received by it in whole or in part, the office making said determination may
provide for correction thereof either by refund or by credit on future bills
in its discretion.



 



   (p)   Where there is a dispute with respect to the sewer service
charges or penalties or both, owing to the City, the Office of Finance, with
the written approval of the City Attorney and subject to the provisions of
the Charter of the City of Los Angeles, may compromise the amount of the
City’s claim for sewer service charges or penalties, or both, which may
apply thereto where the portion of the amount proposed to be released is less
than $500.00; and with the approval of the City Attorney and the City
Council, may compromise such amount where the portion proposed to be released
is $500.00 or more.



 



   (q)   Remedies for collecting and enforcing rates and charges set
out in this article are cumulative and may be pursued alternately, or any
thereof may be used consecutively when the City Council so determines. If any
one of said remedies is or may be invalid, all valid remedies shall remain
effectual until the principal and interest of the bonds are fully paid. Any
holder of any bond outstanding at any time may compel the use of any or all
of the remedies herein provided. The costs of collection and enforcement of
the remedies for the collection or charges may be paid from the revenues. 
(Amended by Ord. No. 162,637, Eff. 8/23/87.)



 



   (r)   Where a singular, non-recurrent, incident occurs on a premises
which results in a discharge of metered water and which is not tributary to
the sewer, upon receipt of a written application and satisfactory evidence,
the Board shall provide for abatement of the Sewer Service Charge applicable
to the volume of water so discharged up to a maximum of $5000.  In the
Board's discretion, the abatement may occur through a refund or a credit on
future bills.  (Amended by Ord. No. 180,157, Eff. 9/26/08.)

   (B)   the user has replaced all existing toilets on the premises
with Ultra-Low-Flush Toilets.



 



      (2)   The user's sewage volume would otherwise be determined

   (d)   (Subsec. (c) Re-lettered (d) by Ord. No. 171,531, Eff. 4/5/97,
Oper. 7/1/97.)  The Board shall provide Water and Power with notices of

cause said notices to be mailed along with the first water bills subsequent
to the effective date of this article which includes sewer service charges,
and will cause copies of said notices to be mailed or otherwise given in
connection with each new application for water service made after the

to the Office of Finance and the Office of Finance shall cause said notices
to be mailed or otherwise distributed to all users or other persons billed by
the Office of Finance whom he has reason to believe has not already received
such notice.



 



   (e)   (Subsec. (d) Re-lettered (e) by Ord. No. 171,531, Eff. 4/5/97,

mailed or delivered with respect to the period for which the user or person
billed seeks adjustment.  However, the application may be made within one
(l) year from the date the bill is mailed or delivered with respect to the
period for which the user or person billed seeks adjustment under the
following two circumstances:



 



   (a)   the premises was unoccupied; or



 



   (b)   the result of the calculation performed by the Department of
Water and Power was inaccurate because of defective water consumption data.



 



   (i)   (Subsec. (h) Re-lettered (i) by Ord. No. 171,531, Eff. 4/5/97,
Oper. 7/1/97.)  The Board shall provide for action to be taken and
determination to be made upon each application for adjustment or exemption
within thirty (30) days from the date said application is filed whenever
reasonably possible, and shall cause the applicant to be immediately notified
in writing of any determination on the application for adjustment. Request
for production of additional information may be made of the applicant, and if
the applicant fails to produce the requested information within thirty (30)
days from the date of mailing the request therefor, proceedings may be
terminated or such other action as is deemed by the Board to be appropriate
may be taken.



 



   (j)   (Subsec. (i) Re-lettered (j) by Ord. No. 171,531, Eff. 4/5/97,
Oper. 7/1/97.)  Any person who has filed an application for adjustment or
exemption and received a determination thereon, and who has likewise complied
with the procedures of this section, may appeal such determination to the
Board pursuant to procedures, rules and regulations adopted by the Board of
such purpose. An appeal must be filed within ten (10) days following the date
of mailing notice of the determination on the request for adjustment or
exemption. The Board shall set a time for hearing the matter, and shall mail
written notice thereof no less than ten (10) days prior to the date of such
hearing to the person who has filed. The notice shall be mailed postage
prepaid to the address designated on said appeal, and also to the address
shown on the original application for adjustment if such is different.



 



   (k)   (Subsec. (j) Re-lettered (k) by Ord. No. 171,531, Eff. 4/5/97,
Oper. 7/1/97.)  A hearing upon an appeal shall be set whenever reasonably
possible no later than thirty (30) days after the date of filing the appeal.
The Board may continue the hearing from time to time in its discretion, and
shall make a written determination upon the appeal within fifteen (15) days
from the conclusion of the hearing and provide a copy thereof to the person
who filed said appeal.



 



   (l)   Any person may, who has complied with the procedures of this
section, may, within ten (10) days of the mailing date of the Board’s
written determination, referred to in (j) above, appeal such decision to the
City Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk. This notice of
appeal shall be in writing and set forth specifically wherein the appellant
believes there was an error or abuse of discretion on the part of the Board.
The Council may then set a time for hearing the matter, and shall mail
written notice thereof no less than ten (10) days prior to the date of such
hearing to the person who has so filed. The notice shall be mailed as
provided in (i) above. If the City Council fails to act within thirty (30)
days after the day of the filing or the appeal with the Office of Finance the
appeal shall be deemed denied.  (Amended by Ord. No. 182,076, Eff. 4/6/12.)



 



   (m)   An adjustment or exemption determination shall become final
upon the termination of time for filing an appeal to the City Council as
provided for in this section where no appeal has been filed; provided that in
the event an appeal has been timely filed, the determination, including
deemed denial, by the City Council upon such appeal shall be final and the
City Council shall so notify the Board.  (Amended by Ord. No. 182,076, Eff.
4/6/12.)



 



   The filing of an application for adjustment or exemption or of an
appeal to the Board or City Council from a determination thereon shall not
stay the continued and further billing during the course of time consumed in
said proceedings, but any such continued and further billing will be
adjusted, if appropriate, at the termination of the proceedings pursuant to
and in conformance with the determination therein; provided, however, that
acceptance of any payment by the City subsequent to the application for
adjustment shall not preclude billing and collection different from or in
excess of such payments and in conformance with said final determination.

   (Amended by Ord. No. 173, 587, Eff. 12/7/00.)



 



   All sewer service charge moneys collected for the City shall be placed
and deposited into the Sewer Construction and Maintenance Fund established by
Section 64.19.2 of this Code, such moneys to be expended for the purposes set
forth in Section 64.41.03(a), of this Code to pay for any refunds, billing,
collection and administration costs related to the sewer service charge and
as security and payment of the principal and interest, premiums, if any, of
bonds and other obligations issued or incurred for sewer related purposes and
to otherwise comply with, be in accordance with, or be in furtherance of, any
provisions of law relating to the issuance of such bonds or other obligations
and the resolutions under which such bonds or other obligations are issued or
incurred. The Office of Finance is hereby authorized to draw demands upon
such fund where necessary to pay Water and Power for its administrative and
other costs in connection with refunds, billing and collecting such sewer
service charge pursuant to arrangements made as set forth in Section
64.41.05(c) of this Code.

   (Added by Ord. No. 162,864, Eff. 11/22/87.)



 



   Upon the issuance of the City’s Wastewater System Revenue Bonds, the
sewer service charges will be pledged as security for such bonds as provided
in the Wastewater System Revenue Bonds General Resolution to be adopted by
the City Council. Any sewer service charges which, pending transfer to the
Sewer Construction and Maintenance Fund, are held in the Water Revenue fund
are, nevertheless, subject to such pledge and such sewer service charges are
impressed with trust as security for the Wastewater System Revenue Bonds
provided that such charges may be used to pay refunds and to provide for the
expenses of the Department of Water and Power associated with the billing,
collection and administrative costs related to the sewer service charge.

   For purposes of this article, the following definitions shall apply:



 



   (a)   “Storm Drainage” – The excess water of the community
received by the storm drain system. From the standpoint of source, it may be
a combination of the runoff from residences, commercial buildings, industrial
plants and institutions, together with any groundwater and surface water that
may be present.



 



   (b)   “Storm Drain System” – All of the property involved in
the operation of the storm drainage collection and disposal system for the

   NOTES:



 



   1.   Parcel identification numbers and corresponding use codes are
taken from the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works records for
Flood Control Benefit Assessment.



 



   2.   A vacant designation (V) with a corresponding run-off factor of
0.0190 is assigned to the total area of those parcels whose improvement value
is $4,000 or less (except parcels with use codes 2700 and 3800 and for 800
series parcel numbers).



 



   3.   A vacant designation (V) with a corresponding run-off factor of
0.0190 is assigned to the vacant portion of parcels whose improvement value
is more than $4,000 if it is determined that the vacant portion is
significant.



 



   4.   Parcels with superseded use codes 010A and 010B that are still
remaining on the Los Angeles County Assessors records are assigned use codes
of 010F and 010H, respectively.



 



   5.   Parcels with unrecognizable use codes are assigned a use code
of 9800 or 9900 and are assessed in the same manner as use code 0100 parcels.



 



   6.   Parcels with unknown areas are assigned an area of 0.1526 acre
(the median single-family residential parcel size).

SEC. 64.51.07.  COLLECTION AND ENFORCEMENT.



 



   (a)   The Stormwater Pollution Abatement Charge for each parcel
shall be collected by and be payable to the Los Angeles County Tax Collector
along with the general taxes levied for City and County purposes and shall be
subject to the same penalties and enforcement provisions relating to general
taxes.  (Amended by Ord. No. 168,980, Eff. 9/12/93.)



 



   (b)   If any portion of the levy, collection or expenditure of the
Stormwater Pollution Abatement Charge provided for herein is declared invalid
or unconstitutional, the remaining levy, collection or expenditure of the
Stormwater Pollution Abatement Charge shall not be affected but remain in
full force and effect.



 



 



SEC. 64.51.09.  ADJUSTMENTS, EXEMPTIONS AND APPEALS.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 175,397, Eff. 9/21/03.)



 



   (a)   The Board shall establish rules and regulations for the
filing, review and determination of adjustments and exemptions, and
consistent with the terms of this section, for any appeals to the Board from
determinations pursuant to this section.



 



   (b)   The Board shall have the power to provide for adjustments
determined by the Board, which reflect, as reasonably as possible, the
receipt from a premises into the storm drain system of quantities of storm
drainage that may be substantially different from average storm drainage, as
this term is used in this section.  In addition the Board shall have the
power to provide for exemptions.



 



   (c)   Where a determination or adjustment or exemption has become
final as provided in this section, future tax bills shall reflect the
adjustment unless otherwise determined by the Board.



 



   (d)   Any user may apply in writing for an adjustment to the office
designated by the Board within 30 days from the date the tax bill is mailed
or delivered with respect to the period for which the user seeks adjustment.



 



   (e)   The Board shall provide for action to be taken and
determination to be made upon each application for adjustment or exemption
within 30 days from the date the application is filed, whenever reasonably
possible, and shall cause the applicant to be immediately notified in writing
of any determination on the application for adjustment. The City may request
production of additional information from the applicant, and if the applicant
fails to produce the requested information within 30 days from the date of
mailing of the request, proceedings may be terminated or other action may be
taken by the Board as it deems appropriate.



 



   (f)   Any person who has filed an application for adjustment or
exemption and received a determination, and who has complied with the
procedures of this section, may appeal the determination to the Board
pursuant to procedures, rules and regulations adopted by the Board for that
purpose.  An appeal must be filed within ten days following the date of
mailing notice of the determination on the request for adjustment or
exemption. The Board shall set a time for hearing the matter, and shall mail
written notice of the hearing no fewer than ten days prior to the date of the
hearing to the person who has filed.  The notice shall be mailed postage
prepaid to the address designated on the appeal, and also to the address
shown on the original application for adjustment if that address is different.



 



   (g)   A hearing upon an appeal shall be set, whenever reasonably
possible, no later than 30 days after the date of filing the appeal.  The
Board may continue the hearing from time to time in its discretion, and shall
make a written determination upon the appeal within 15 days from the
conclusion of the hearing and provide a copy of the determination to the
person who filed the appeal.



 



   (h)   Any person who has complied with the procedures of this
section, may, within ten days of the mailing date of the Board’s written
determination, referred to in (h) above, appeal the decision to the City
Council by filing a notice of appeal with the City Clerk. This notice of
appeal shall be in writing and set forth specifically where the appellant
believes there was an error or abuse of discretion on the part of the
Board.  The Council may then set a time for hearing the matter, and shall
mail written notice of that hearing no fewer than ten days prior to the date
of the hearing to the person who has so filed.  The notice shall be mailed
as provided in (f) above.  If the City Council fails to act within 30 days
after the day of the filing or the appeal with the City Clerk the appeal
shall be deemed denied.



 



   (i)   An adjustment or exemption determination shall become final
upon the termination of time for filing an appeal to the City Council as
provided for in this section where no appeal has been filed.  In the event
an appeal has been timely filed, the City Council’s ruling on the appeal
shall be final and the City Council shall notify the Board of its
determination.  In either event, the Board shall cause written notice of the
final adjustment determination to be immediately given to the City Clerk.



 



   The filing of an application for adjustment or exemption, or of an
appeal to the Board or City Council from a determination, shall not stay the
continued and further billing of SPAC during the course of time consumed in
the proceedings, but any billing during this time may be adjusted, if
appropriate, at the termination of the proceedings pursuant to and in
conformance with the determination made on the matter.  However, acceptance
of any payment by the Los Angeles County Tax Collector on behalf of the City
subsequent to an application for adjustment shall not preclude billing and
collection of a sum different from, or in excess of, the payments and in
conformance with the final determination.



 



   (j)   Upon the discovery of any mistake or error pertaining to the
application of the Use Code, Area, or Run-Off Factor that affects the amount
of SPAC for a parcel as calculated by the Los Angeles County Tax Collector,
the City shall request that the County make the appropriate adjustments for
future billings.  The City shall have authority to issue any refund due to
the property owner(s).



 



   (k)   Any refunds or adjustments authorized by this Section are
subject to the following:



 



   If the amount to be refunded or adjusted does not exceed $10,000, the
Director or the designated head of the Bureau of Sanitation or designee is
authorized to adjust the billing or submit the appropriate refund to the
property owner(s).



 



   If the amount to be refunded or adjusted is greater than $10,000, the
Board of Public Works must approve authorization for the refund or adjustment.



 



   If the amount to be refunded or adjusted exceeds the intra-departmental
transfer limit pursuant to City Charter Section 343(a), (b) and (c), the City
Council must approve authorization for the refund or adjustment.

1996, and thereafter in the amount of five (5) percent of Total Operating
Revenues received on a cash basis by the Sewer Construction and Maintenance
Fund.  Said Franchise Fee is imposed for each year of operation, or portion
thereof, beginning on September 1, 1995, which date is the effective date of
its operation.  Commencing on July 1, 1996, the year of operation for which
the franchise fee is imposed shall be from July 1 of each year through June
30 of the following year.  Effective July 1, 2000, the Franchise Fee shall
be 3.333% (percent) of Total Operating Revenues received on a cash basis by

   A.   Title.  This article is known as “Stormwater and Urban
Runoff Pollution Control” and may be so cited.



 



   B.   Objectives.  The Watershed Protection Program (Stormwater
Program) for the City of Los Angeles is managed by the Bureau of Sanitation
along with all City Flood Protection and Pollution Abatement (Water Quality)
Programs including, but not limited to, regulatory compliance,
implementation, operations, reporting and funding.  This article sets forth
uniform requirements and prohibitions for discharges and places of discharge
into the storm drain system and receiving waters necessary to adequately
enforce and administer all federal and state laws, legal standards, orders
and/or special orders that provide for the protection, enhancement and
restoration of water quality.  Through a program employing watershed-based
approaches that balance environmental and economic considerations, and under
the jurisdiction of the Board of Public Works, the City seeks to protect and
promote the public health, safety and general prosperity of its citizens with
the implementation of the following objectives:  (Amended by Ord. No.
183,833, Eff. 10/3/15.)



 



   1.   To comply with all Federal and State laws, lawful standards and
orders applicable to stormwater and urban runoff pollution control;



 



   2.   To prohibit any discharge which may interfere with the
operation of, or cause any damage to the storm drain system, or impair the
beneficial use of the receiving waters;



 



   3.   To prohibit illicit discharges to the storm drain system;



 



   4.   To reduce stormwater runoff pollution;



 



   5.   To reduce non-stormwater discharge to the storm drain system to
the maximum extent practicable; and

   (A)   Objective.  (Amended by Ord. No. 183,833, Eff. 10/3/15.) 
The provisions of this section contain requirements for construction
activities and facility operations of Development and Redevelopment projects
to comply with the Land Development requirements of the MS4 permit though 
integrating LID practices and standards for stormwater pollution mitigation,
and maximize open, green and pervious space on all Developments and
Redevelopments consistent with the City's landscape ordinance and other
related requirements in the Development Best Management Practices Handbook.



 



   (B)   Scope.  (Amended by Ord. No. 183,833, Eff. 10/3/15.)  This
section contains requirements for stormwater pollution control measures in
Development and Redevelopment projects and authorizes the Board to further
define and adopt stormwater pollution control measures, develop LID
principles and requirements, including, but not limited to, the objectives
and specifications for integration of LID strategies, collect Best Management
Practices compliance plan check fees, collect funds for projects that are
granted waivers, conduct inspections, cite violators for infractions and
impose fines.  Except as otherwise provided herein, the Board shall
administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this section.



 



   (C)   LID Requirements.  (Amended by Ord. No. 183,833, Eff.
10/3/15.)  All Developments and Redevelopments shall comply with the
following:



 



   1.   Development or Redevelopment involving four or fewer units
intended for residential use shall implement LID BMP alternatives identified
in the Development Best Management Practices Handbook.



 



   2.   Development or Redevelopment Involving Nonresidential Use or
Five or More Units Intended for Residential Use.



 



   a.   Development or Redevelopment resulting in an alteration of at
least 50% or more of the impervious surfaces on an existing developed Site,
the entire Site must comply with the standards and requirements of this
article and with the Development Best Management Practices Handbook; and



 



   b.   Development or Redevelopment resulting in an alteration of less
than 50% of the impervious surfaces of an existing developed Site, only such
incremental Development shall comply with the standards and requirements of
this article and with the Development Best Management Practices Handbook.



 



   3.   A Development or Redevelopment of any size that would create
2,500 square feet or more of impervious surface area and is located partly or
wholly within an ESA shall comply with the standards and requirements of this
article and with the Development Best Management Practices Handbook.



 



   4.   A Development or Redevelopment of any size that would create
more than 10,000 square feet or more of impervious surface area and total one
acre or more of disturbed area shall comply with the standards and
requirements of this article and with the Development Best Management
Practices Handbook.



 



   5.   Street and road construction of 10,000 square feet or more of
impervious surface area shall comply with the standards and requirements of
the Development Best Management Practices Handbook.



 



   6.   The Site for every Development or Redevelopment shall be
designed to manage and capture stormwater runoff, to the maximum extent
feasible, in priority order:  infiltration, evapotranspiration, capture and
use, treated through high removal efficiency biofiltration/biotreatment
system of all of the runoff on site.  High removal efficiency
biofiltration/biotreatment systems shall comply with the standards and
requirements of the Development Best Management Practices Handbook.  A LID
Plan shall be prepared to comply with the following:



 



   a.   Stormwater runoff will be infiltrated, evapotranspired,
captured and used, treated through high removal efficiency Best Management
Practices, onsite, through stormwater management techniques that comply with
the provisions of the Development Best Management Practices Handbook.  To
the maximum extent feasible, onsite stormwater management techniques must be
properly sized, at a minimum, to infiltrate, evapotranspire, store for use,
treat through high removal efficiency biofiltration/biotreatment system,
without any storm water runoff leaving the Site for at least the volume of
water produced by the Stormwater Quality Design Volume (SWQDv) that results
from the greater of:



 



   (i)   The volume of runoff produced from a 0.75-inch storm event; or



 



   (ii)   The 85th percentile, 24-hour runoff event, as determined from
the Los Angeles County 85th percentile precipitation isohyetal map.



 



   For purposes of compliance with the LID requirements, and without
changing the priority order of design preferences identified in this section,
all runoff from the SWQDv, as identified in Paragraph (a) of this
subdivision, that has been treated through an onsite high removal efficiency
biofiltration/biotreatment system shall be deemed to have achieved 100%
infiltration regardless of the runoff leaving the Site from an onsite high
removal efficiency biofiltration/biotreatment system, and thus any runoff
volume shall not be subject to the offsite mitigation requirement of this
article.



 



   b.   Pollutants shall be prevented from leaving the Site for a SWQDv
as defined in Paragraph (a) of this subdivision unless it has been treated
through an onsite high removal efficiency biofiltration/biotreatment system.



 



   c.   Hydromodification impacts shall be minimized to natural
drainage systems as defined in the MS4 Permit.



 



   7.   When, as determined by the Director, the onsite LID
requirements are technically infeasible, partially or fully, as defined in
the Development Best Management Handbook, the infeasibility shall be
demonstrated in the submitted LID Plan, shall be consistent with other City
requirements and shall be reviewed in consultation with the Department of
Building and Safety.  The technical infeasibility may result from conditions
that may include, but are not limited to:



 



   a.   Locations where seasonal high groundwater is within ten feet of
surface grade;



 



   b.   Locations within 100 feet of a groundwater well used for
drinking water;



 



   c.   Brownfield Development sites or other locations where pollutant
mobilization is a documented concern;



 



   d.   Locations with potential geotechnical hazards;



 



   e.   Locations with impermeable soil type as indicated in applicable
soils and geotechnical reports; and



 



   f.   Other site or implementation constraints identified in the
Development Best Management Practices Handbook.



 



   8.   If partial or complete onsite compliance of any type is
technically infeasible, the project Site and LID Plan shall be required to
manage the flow from the SWQDv onsite in order to maximize onsite
compliance.  For the remaining runoff that cannot feasibly be managed
onsite, the project shall implement offsite mitigation on public and/or
private land within the same sub-watershed as defined by the MS4 Permit. 
This shall include construction and perpetual maintenance of projects that
will achieve at least the same level of runoff retention, infiltration and/or
use, and water quality.  All City Departments will assist the developer,
when and where feasible, in the design, permitting and implementation of LID
BMP projects within the public right-of-way, with a preference for utilizing
the public right-of-way immediately adjacent to the subject development.



 



   9.   A Multi-Phased Project may comply with the standards and
requirements of this section for all of its phases by:  (a) designing a
system acceptable to the Bureau of Sanitation to satisfy these standards and
requirements for the entire Site during the first phase; and (b) implementing
these standards and requirements for each phase of Development or
Redevelopment of the Site during the first phase or prior to commencement of
construction of a later phase, to the extent necessary to treat the
stormwater from such later phase.  For purposes of this section,
"Multi-Phased Project" shall mean any Development or Redevelopment
implemented over more than one phase, and the Site of a Multi-Phased Project
shall include any land and water area designed and used to store, treat or
manage stormwater runoff in connection with the Development or Redevelopment,
including any tracts, lots or parcels of real property, whether Developed or
not, associated with, functionally connected to, or under common ownership or
control with such Development or Redevelopment.



 



   10.   The Director shall prepare, maintain and update, as deemed
necessary and appropriate, the Development Best Management Practices Handbook
to set LID standards and practices and standards for stormwater pollution
mitigation, including urban and stormwater runoff quantity and quality
control development principles and technologies for achieving the LID
standards.  The Development Best Management Practices Handbook shall also
include technical feasibility and implementation parameters, alternative
compliance for technical infeasibility, as well as other rules, requirements
and procedures as the Director deems necessary for implementing the
provisions of this section of the Los Angeles Municipal Code.  The Board of
Public Works shall adopt the Development Best Management Practices Handbook
no later than 90 days after the adoption of this ordinance by the City
Council and the Mayor.



 



   11.   The Director of the Bureau of Sanitation shall develop as
deemed necessary and appropriate, in cooperation with other City departments
and stakeholders, informational bulletins, training manuals and educational
materials to assist in the implementation of the LID requirements.



 



   12.   The applicant can appeal the Director's determination of
compliance with the provisions of this article to the Board of Public Works
within 30 days of the date of the determination.



 



   13.   Any Development or Redevelopment that is exempted from LID
requirements under Section D has the option to voluntarily opt in and
incorporate into the project the LID requirements set forth herein.  In such
case, the Best Management Practices plan check fee associated with the
project shall be waived and all LID related plan check processes shall be
expedited.



 



   (D)   Exceptions to LID Requirements.  The provisions of this
Section do not apply to any of the following:



 



   1.   A Development or Redevelopment that only creates, adds or
replaces less than 500 square feet of impervious area;



 



   2.   A Development or Redevelopment involving only emergency
construction activity required to immediately protect public health and
safety;



 



   3.   Infrastructure projects within the public right-of-way;



 



   4.   A Development or Redevelopment involving only activity related
to gas, water, cable, or electricity services on private property;

written notice of penalties assessed pursuant to the provisions of this
Subsection by issuance of a Notice of Penalty Assessment.  Delivery of each

66.32.1, reporting and documentation requirements imposed pursuant to the
provisions of Subsection (c) of Section 66.32.1, and payment of fees imposed

Penalty Assessment, Notice of Suspension or Notice of Revocation pursuant to
the provisions of Subsections (b) or (c) of this Section, and the Person
believes that the Notice was issued in error or that the penalty assessed was
excessive or in error, the Person may appeal by filing, within thirty (30)
days of when the Bureau of Sanitation mailed the Notice of Penalty
Assessment, Notice of Suspension or Notice of Revocation, a written request
for a hearing before the Board.  If the Board does not receive the written
request for a hearing within thirty (30) days of when the Bureau of
Sanitation mailed the Notice of Penalty Assessment, Notice of Suspension or
Notice of Revocation, the penalty assessment, suspension, or revocation,
whichever is applicable, shall be deemed final and no further administrative
relief can be obtained.



 



   (2)   If an Appellant timely files a written request for a hearing
pursuant to the provisions of Subdivision (1) of this Subsection, the penalty
assessment, suspension or revocation that is the subject of the request shall
be stayed pending a hearing before the Board.



 



   (3)   After receipt of a written request for a hearing filed
pursuant to and in compliance with the provisions of Subdivision (1) of this
Subsection, the Board will set the matter on one of its regular agendas as
soon thereafter the Board deems practical.  At the Board hearing, the Board
shall hear the testimony of the Appellant, Bureau of Sanitation staff, and
other testimony it deems relevant.  Appellant shall have the burden of
proof, and shall present substantial evidence on the Appellant's behalf. 
Upon conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall issue a verbal or written
decision.  The Board may affirm the Notice of Suspension or Notice of
Revocation or rescind it, and may affirm the penalty assessment, decrease it,
or cancel it.  If the Board affirms a Notice of Suspension or Notice of
Revocation, the suspension or revocation shall be effective on the date of
the Board's decision, unless the Board decides otherwise, if the Board
affirms a penalty assessment, the amount affirmed shall be owed thirty (30)
days after issuance of the Board's decision, unless the Board decides
otherwise. Once the Board issues a decision, the matter is final and no
further administrative relief is provided by the City.



 



   (e)   Authority to Take Possession of Permit.  The Director of the
Bureau of Sanitation, or an authorized representative, may take possession of
any AB 939 Compliance Permit, or other document issued pursuant to the
provisions of Section 66.32 through 66.32.2, which is expired or is

AND MULTIFAMILY SOLID WASTE



 



 



SEC. 66.33.  PURPOSE.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 184,665, Eff. 1/25/17.)



 



   Under the City's RENEW LA Plan, the City committed to reaching Zero
Waste by diverting 70 percent of the solid waste generated in the City by
2013, diverting 90 percent by 2025, and becoming a Zero Waste city by 2030. 
State law currently requires at least 50 percent solid waste diversion and
establishes a state-wide goal of 75 percent diversion by 2020.  Moreover,
state law requires mandatory commercial recycling in all businesses and
multifamily complexes and imposes additional reporting requirements on local
agencies, including the City.  In order to meet these requirements and
goals, increasing recycling and diversion in the commercial and multifamily
waste sectors is imperative.  The commercial and multifamily sectors produce
most of the City's solid waste.  Currently, a significant amount of
commercial and multifamily solid waste generated in the City, including
recyclables and organics, is going to landfills, resulting in unnecessary
greenhouse gas emissions.  The City has a responsibility under state law to
ensure effective and efficient waste and recycling service for its businesses
and residents.  The City will fulfill that responsibility most successfully,
and also meet its own Zero Waste policy goals, by ensuring that its solid
waste, including recyclables and organics, are collected, transported and
processed in a manner that reduces environmental and social impacts on the
City and the region.



 



   An exclusive, competitive franchise system for the collection,
transportation and processing of commercial and multifamily solid waste will
aid the City in meeting its diversion goals by, among other things:  (i)
requiring franchisees to meet diversion targets; (ii) increasing the capacity
for partnership between the City and solid waste haulers; (iii) allowing the
City to establish consistent methods for diversion of recyclables and
organics; (iv) increasing the City's ability to track diversion, which will
enable required reporting and monitoring of state mandated commercial and
multifamily recycling; (v) increasing the City's ability to ensure diversion
quality in the processing facilities handling its waste and recyclables; and
(vi) increasing the City's capacity to enforce compliance with federal,
state, county and local standards.



 



   An exclusive, competitive franchise system will also have other
beneficial effects, including a reduction in adverse environmental impacts
– unnecessary solid waste truck traffic as well as emissions and street
degradation – and also protection of ratepayers, ensuring high customer
service standards, and increase in solid waste hauler accountability.



 



   As the City moves towards its Zero Waste goals through an exclusive
franchise system, technology also should improve over the course of time to
increase source reduction, recycling and composting, and diversion
opportunities and capabilities.  Relatedly, so too should the opportunities
increase in number and diversity of qualified subcontractors to perform work
industry-wide, including opportunities for development and mentoring of
franchisees and subcontractors.  The City has an interest in increasing the
number and diversity of qualified personnel in the solid waste and recycling
industry, especially as to those individuals available to service the City.



 



   While the move to an exclusive franchise system will generate many
benefits for the City and its residents, the change also will increase the
risk that a labor dispute will interfere with collection services.  To
protect the City's interest in efficient and uninterrupted collection
services, the City will require franchisees to produce evidence that they are
parties to written, enforceable agreements that prohibit labor organizations
and their members from engaging in picketing, work stoppages, boycotts or
other economic interference with collection services.

be under the direction, supervision, and control of the Director of Finance.



 



   (b)   The Director of Finance shall arrange for the billing and
collection of, and accounting for, the charges imposed under this article
through and by available facilities of the Department of Water and Power
insofar as possible. The Director of the Office of Administrative and
Research Services shall arrange for the payment to the Department of Water
and Power of its costs of such services. To the extent the billing and
collection by the Department of Water and Power is not deemed possible or
practical by the Director of Finance, separate billing and collection
services at reasonable intervals shall be provided by the Director of Finance.



 



   (c)   The charges imposed under this article shall be billed to and
paid by the customer in whose name the electric meter serving each dwelling
unit is listed upon the records of the Department of Water and Power, or, in
the absence of such listing, as may be determined by the Director of Finance
with the assistance of the Department of Public Works.



 



   (d)   The duty to collect the charges imposed under this article
from each customer billed by the Department of Water and Power shall commence
with the first billing submitted by said Department to each customer on or
after the operative date of this article or as soon thereafter as
administratively possible.



 



   (e)   The charges imposed under this article shall be billed by the
Department of Water and Power in accordance with its regular billing
practices, shall be added to and included on each applicable electric bill,
as the case may be, and shall be due and payable to the City of Los Angeles
through the Department of Water and Power at the time and in the manner of
payment of said electric bill, and other charges made thereon.



 



   (f)   Where the Department of Water and Power does not supply
electricity to a individual dwelling unit to which the City furnishes
household refuse collection services, the customer liable for payment of the
charges, as provided for in this article, shall be billed separately by the
Director of Finance with the assistance of the Department of Public Works.



 



   (g)   All bills for the charges imposed under this article are due
and payable upon presentation. Bills not paid within sixty (60) days after
the date of presentation shall be deemed delinquent.



 



   (h)   Whenever the Director of Finance determines that a customer
billed has deliberately withheld, failed or refused to pay all or any part or
portion of the charges imposed under this article billed to said customer, or
has failed to pay charges, or whenever the Director of Finance deems it to be
in the best interest of the City, the Director of Finance shall serve notice
on the customer billed of his or her delinquency.



 



   Whenever the Director of Finance determines that a customer billed as
provided for in this article has deliberately withheld, failed or refused to
pay all or any part or portion of the charges imposed under this article
billed to said customer by the Department of Water and Power, or has failed
to pay said charges, or whenever the Director of Finance deems it to be in
the best interest of the City, the Director of Finance may relieve the
Department of Water and Power of any obligation it may have to bill or
collect, or both, said charges from said customer billed, and assume the
billing or collection, or both, thereof for the periods involved. If the
Director of Finance, for whatever reason, assumes from the Department of
Water and Power the direct billing or collection, or both, of the charges
imposed under this article the Director of Finance may at said time so notify
the customer billed and notify the customer of his or her delinquency, if
such be the case.



 



   The notice in either event shall be served on the customer billed by
handing it to him or her personally, or by deposit in the United States mail,
postage prepaid thereon, addressed to the customer billed at the address to
which billing was made by the Department of Water and Power, or, if said
address has been changed or the customer was not billed by the Department of
Water and Power, then to his or her last known address. If the customer
billed is delinquent and fails to pay the Director of Finance within fifteen
(15) days from the date of service of the notice upon him or her which shall
be the date of mailing if service is not accomplished by personal delivery, a
penalty of twenty-five percent (25%) of the amount of the delinquent charges
imposed under this article, but not less than $5.00, shall thereupon be
imposed. The penalty shall be required to be paid in addition to all billings
for the sanitation equipment charge.



 



   (i)   Whenever a payment mailed to the City is received after the
time prescribed in this article for the receipt thereof, the Director of
Finance or the Department of Water and Power, as the case may be, may accept
proof that there had been a timely deposit thereof in the United States mail
and that the no delinquency or penalty is applicable thereto.

enforcement of the provisions of this article.



 



   (b)   For the purpose of determining the number of dwelling units
contained in any building the Bureau of Sanitation may estimate the number of

information within his or her knowledge.



 



   (c)   The Director of Finance, on behalf of and in the name of the
City of Los Angeles, may enter into a written agreement, in a form approved
by the City Attorney, with any customer indebted to the City pursuant to the
terms of this article, obligating said customer to pay such indebtedness to
the Director of Finance in monthly or more frequent installments, but in no
event over a period greater than one year. In any such agreement such
customer shall acknowledge the obligation owed to the City and his or her
indebtedness thereon, shall agree that in the event of his or her failure to
make timely payment of any installment thereof that the whole amount unpaid
may be determined by the Director of Finance to be immediately due and
payable, and shall agree to pay all costs and reasonable attorney fees
incurred by or on behalf of the City in the collection thereof or for any
legal proceeding commenced for that purpose.



 



   (d)   Whenever the amount of charges and penalty imposed under this
article, or either of them, is determined by the Department of Water and
Power or by the Director of Finance to have been overpaid, paid more than
once, or to have been erroneously collected or received by the City in whole
or in part, the Department of Water and Power or the Director of Finance, as
the case may be, may provide for correction thereof either by refund or by
credit on future bills in its or his or her discretion. Any claim for such a
refund or credit shall be filed with the Director of Finance by the person
paying the alleged overpayment within six months of such payment.



 



   (e)   Where there is a dispute with respect to the charges or
penalty imposed under this article, or both, the Director of Finance, with
the written approval of the City Attorney and subject to the provisions of
the Charter of the City of Los Angeles, may compromise the City’s claim for
said charges or penalty, or both, where the portion of the claim proposed to
be released is less than $5,000.00; and, with the approval of the City
Attorney and the City Council, may compromise such a claim where the portion
proposed to be released is $5,000.00 or more.



 



 



SEC. 66.45.  ACTIONS TO COLLECT.



 



   The charges imposed under this article, and any penalty thereon, shall
be a civil debt owing to the City of Los Angeles from the occupants or owner,
or both, of each dwelling unit receiving City household refuse collection
services, or from any other customer billed as provided in this article. Any
customer owing money to the City under the provisions of this article shall
be liable in an action brought in the name of the City of Los Angeles in any
court of competent jurisdiction for the recovery of such amount, including
any penalty imposed under this article.

   (Amended by Ord. No. 173,293, Eff. 6/30/00, Oper. 7/1/00.)



 



   If the Director of Finance finds that he or she cannot collect the
charges and penalty imposed under this article, or either of them, or that
efforts to collect any such amount would be disproportionately costly with
relation to the probable outcome of the collection efforts, the Director of
Financemay prepare a report setting forth his or her finding and the reasons
therefor, and submit it to a Board of Review which shall be composed of the
City Controller, the Director of Finance and the City Attorney, or the duly
appointed representative of each. The Board of Review may call for additional
evidence which it may deem relevant. Upon unanimous approval of a finding by
the Board of Review, the Director of Finance may remove from his or her
active accounts receivable said unpaid charges and penalty, or either of
them. If the Board of Review does not unanimously recommend approval of the
finding, the matter shall be returned to the Director of Finance. The
Director of Finance may include in a single report his or her findings and
supporting reasons regarding the charges and penalty imposed under this
article, or either of them, due from more than one customer. The removal from
the active accounts receivable of the Director of Financeof any unpaid
charges and penalty imposed under this article, or either of them, shall not
preclude the City from collecting or attempting to collect any such charges
and penalty, or either of them.



 



 



SEC. 66.47.  REFUNDS AND CREDITS.



 



   In the event a customer does not own or occupy a dwelling unit for any
month for which he or she has paid the charge he or she shall submit evidence
to the Department of Public Works in support of a refund and if the
Department is satisfied such a refund is warranted it shall so provide it.
Any request for such a refund, however, must be within six months of the
payment by the customer for which the refund is sought and must be submitted
to the Director of Finance (Amended by Ord. No. 173,293, Eff. 6/30/00, Oper.
7/1/00.).



 



 



SEC. 66.48.  EXTRA CAPACITY REFUSE COLLECTION FEE.



   (Added by Ord. No. 170,868, Eff. 2/19/96.)



 



   A.   DECLARATION OF POLICY.  It is hereby declared that in order
for the City of Los Angeles to be prepared to respond to the needs of its
citizens for adequate solid waste disposal alternatives in the future, it is
necessary to recognize that there is currently limited landfill capacity for
solid waste disposal within the greater Los Angeles area, that new landfills
are difficult to site and permit, and that the State has imposed recycling
and waste reduction requirements in order to reduce the total amount of solid
waste going to landfill by 25% and 50% by 1995 and 2000, respectively. 
Therefore, the City must establish a clear policy to provide an incentive for
residents to reduce and to recycle the quantity of solid waste they
generate.  To accomplish this end, the City has developed a standard
allowance for collection and management of refuse, yard trimmings, and horse
manure which the City deems adequate to meet the requirements of the average
dwelling unit as defined in Section 66.40.  The City hereby declares that
the standard allowance for a parcel with one dwelling unit shall be one
60-gallon black container for refuse and one 90-gallon green container for
yard trimmings.  The standard allowance for a parcel with more than one
dwelling unit is one 60-gallon black container per dwelling unit and one
90-gallon green container for yard trimmings for the parcel.  Additional
capacity above and beyond this standard allowance may be made available for
various fees as described in this Code.  (Amended by Ord. No. 174,699, Eff.
8/22/02.)



 



   B.   CONTINUOUS EXTRA CAPACITY.



 



   1.   A $5.00 per month fee will be charged for each 30-gallon
increment of extra refuse capacity made available to a dwelling unit by
replacing the standard allowance 60-gallon black container with a single
larger, 90-gallon black container or issuing additional 30, 60 or 90-gallon
black containers.



 



   Residents who qualify for the lifeline requirements as set forth in
LAMC Section 21.1.12 shall receive the first 30 gallons of extra refuse
capacity at no charge and additional capacity beyond the first 30 gallons at
50 % of the extra refuse capacity fee.



 



   High Density Households who qualify under the Department of Water and
Power (DWP) water rate program shall receive the first 30 gallons of extra
capacity without charge if their household has 7 to 10 residents and shall
receive the first 60 gallons of extra capacity without charge if their
household has over 11 residents.  Additional increments beyond those
increments shall be charge at the regular fee.



 



   2.   A $5.00 per month fee will be charged for each 30-gallon
increment of horse manure capacity requested by a resident for a dwelling
unit.  The City will issue specially marked 30, 60 or 90 gallon green
containers for the limited purpose of horse manure pickup.



 



   3.   A $2.50 per month fee will be charged for each 30-gallon
increment of extra yard trimmings capacity made available to a dwelling unit
by replacing the standard allowance 60-gallon green container with a larger,
90-gallon green container or issuing additional 30, 60, or 90-gallon green
containers.  However, if a single-family dwelling unit is built on two or
more residential lots, the dwelling unit shall be entitled to one additional
60-gallon green container at no extra charge from the City.  In the event
that a second dwelling unit is built on the site, each dwelling unit shall
only be entitled to one 60-gallon green container at no charge and any
additional capacity requested by either dwelling unit will be charged as set
forth above.  Yard trimmings shall be defined as wood waste, brush, grass
clippings, plant and tree trimmings, leaves, Christmas trees and other
organic material all of which must be free from inorganic material and food
waste.



 



   4.   The fees described in Subdivisions 1, 2 and 3 of this section
will be billed through the  DWP bill on the line item generally titled
Sanitation Equipment Charge where it will be added to the existing charges
found thereon and deposited to the Sanitation Equipment Charge Special
Revenue Fund.  Larger, or extra containers, will be delivered to a dwelling
unit at a resident’s request, and will be recorded through the container
serial number to the name of the person appearing on the DWP bill, or their
designated agent, for each respective dwelling unit.  The fee imposed by
this article shall be a joint and several charge against the occupants and
the owner of each dwelling unit subject to the charge.  Residents may use
this extra capacity once per week on their regular collection day.  Failure
to use all of the requested extra capacity will not relieve the resident from
paying the monthly extra capacity fee.  The fees will be collected as
described in LAMC Sections 66.43, 66.44, 66.45, 66.46 and 66.47.



 



   C.   INTERMITTENT EXTRA CAPACITY.  Residents of all dwelling units
shall have the ability to purchase the right to have additional refuse, horse
manure or yard trimmings collected by the City on a collection day to
collection day basis.  The resident requiring this additional intermittent
capacity shall purchase from the City, at a cost of $2.00 per 30 gallons of
additional capacity, a special tag to be placed on the additional materials
for collection.  The tags must be purchased in advance, in person at various
locations throughout the City, or through the mail, and can be utilized only
on the regular collection day.  Each tag may be used only one time. 
(Amended by Ord. No. 178,875, Eff. 7/23/07.)



 



   D.   IMPLEMENTATION.



 



   1.   The Board shall have the power and duty, and is hereby directed
to enforce all of the provisions of this article, except as otherwise set
forth herein, and shall provide such rules and regulations as are consistent
with the provisions of this article and as may be necessary or desirable to
aid in the administration, including adjustments and enforcement of the extra
capacity charge.



 



   2.   The Board or any of its authorized representative may make such
inspections or investigations as said Board deems necessary at any reasonable
time on any premises or lot for the purpose of determining the number, size,
and type of automated collection containers.



 



   E.   EFFECTIVE DATE.  The fees described in Subsections B and C
will become effective starting 30 days after DWP notifies the Office of
Finance (Amended by Ord. No. 173,587, Eff. 12/7/00.) that its billing system
has been modified to include the Extra Capacity Fees.



 



   F.   FEE ADJUSTMENTS.  The fees described herein shall be reviewed
on a yearly basis to determine if any adjustments need to be made to cover
changes in operating cost.

SEC. 69.00.  FINDING.



 



   The Council of the City of Los Angeles hereby finds that the Marina del
Rey Entrance Channel is a unique portion of the City of Los Angeles and
requires special rules and regulations which cannot properly be applicable to
any other portion of the City of Los Angeles. The reason for said uniqueness
is that the Marina del Rey Entrance Channel is owned by the County of Los
Angeles but is located within the City of Los Angeles. It is the means
whereby small boats traverse from the Pacific Ocean into the Marina del Rey,
a small boat harbor owned and operated by the County of Los Angeles and
located within unincorporated territory. The provisions of this article shall
be applicable only to the Marina del Rey Entrance Channel.

   “Marina del Rey Entrance Channel” as used herein, and to which this
article is applicable, shall mean all those inland waters of the State of
California and lying within the city limits of the City of Los Angeles, lying
northeasterly of the Marina del Rey Detached Breakwater and bounded by lines
drawn northeasterly and perpendicular to the shore from lights 1 and 2 of
said Breakwater (and being more particularly described as those waters inside
of the lines of the “high seas” as described in Section 6552(f)(13),
Title 14, of the California Administrative Code).
