SEC. 111.01.  DEFINITIONS.



 



   Unless the context otherwise clearly indicates, the words and phrases
used in this chapter are defined as follows:



 



   (a)   “Ambient Noise” is the composite of noise from all sources
near and far in a given environment, exclusive of occasional and transient
intrusive noise sources and of the particular noise source or sources to be
measured. Ambient noise shall be averaged over a period of at least 15
minutes at a location and time of day comparable to that during which the
measurement is taken of the particular noise source being measured. (Amended
by Ord. No. 156,363, Eff. 3/29/82.)



 



   (b)   “Commercial Purpose” is the use, operation, or maintenance
of any sound amplifying equipment for the purpose of advertising any
business, goods, or services, or for the purpose of attracting the attention
of the public to, advertising for, or soliciting patronage or customers to or
for any performance, show, entertainment, exhibition, or event, or for the
purpose of demonstrating such sound equipment. (Amended by Ord. No. 156,363,
Eff. 3/29/82.)



 



   (c)   “Decibel” (dB) is a unit of level which denotes the ratio
between two (2) quantities which are proportional to power; the number of
decibels corresponding to the ratio of two (2) amounts of power is ten (10)
times the logarithm to the base (10) of this ratio. (Amended by Ord. No.
156,363, Eff. 3/29/82.)

than one second, with an abrupt onset and rapid decay. By way of example
“impulsive sound” shall include, but shall not be limited to, explosions,
musical base drum beats, or the discharge of firearms. (Amended by Ord. No.
156,363, Eff. 3/29/82.)

SEC. 111.02.  SOUND LEVEL MEASUREMENT PROCEDURE AND CRITERIA.



   (Title amended by Ord. No. 156,363, Eff. 3/29/82.)



 



   (a)   (Amended by Ord. No. 156,363, Eff. 3/29/82.)  Any sound level
measurement made pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be measured
with a sound level meter using the “A” weighting and response as
indicated in Section 111.01(k) of this article.



 



   Except when impractical, the microphone shall be located four to five
feet above the ground and ten feet or more from the nearest reflective
surface.  However, in those cases where another elevation is deemed
appropriated, the latter shall be utilized.



 



   Interior sound level measurements shall be made at a point at least
four feet from the wall, ceiling, or floor nearest the noise source.



 



   Calibration of the sound level meter, utilizing an acoustic calibrator
shall be performed immediately prior to recording any sound level data.  The
ambient noise level and the level of a particular noise being measured shall
be the numerical average of noise measurements taken at a given location
during a given time period.



 



   (b)   (Amended by Ord. No. 156,363, Eff. 3/29/82.) Where the sound
alleged to be offending is of a type or character set forth below, the
following values shall be added to the sound level measurement of the
offending noise:



 



   1.   Except for noise emanating from any electrical transformer or
gas metering and pressure control equipment existing and installed prior to
the effective date of the ordinance enacting this chapter, any steady tone
with audible fundamental frequency or overtones have 200 Hz.....+5



 



   2.   Repeated impulsive noise.....+5



 



   3.   Noise occurring more than 5 but less than 15 minutes in any
period of 60 consecutive minutes between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00
p.m. of any day.....-5



 



   4.   Noise occurring five minutes or less in any period of 60
consecutive minutes, between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 p.m. of any
day.....-5  (Amended by Ord. No. 161,574, Eff. 9/8/86.)



 



   (c)   For those cases where an objectionable noise is clearly
audible, but where the level of ambient noise does not permit direct
quantative sound level “A” measurements of the objectionable noise, sound
measurements may be performed utilizing an octave band sound analyzer to
determine sound level “A” limits as indicated in the Table I below. 
This table is used to convert the sound pressure level meter readings in dB
for each band to SPL in dB(A) for each band.
