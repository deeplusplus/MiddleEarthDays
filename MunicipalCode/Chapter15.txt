SEC. 151.00.  TITLE.



 



   This chapter shall be known as the Rent Stabilization Ordinance of the
City of Los Angeles.



 



 



SEC. 151.01.  DECLARATION OF PURPOSE.



 



   There is a shortage of decent, safe and sanitary housing in the City of
Los Angeles resulting in a critically low vacancy factor.



 



   Tenants displaced as a result of their inability to pay increased rents
must relocate but as a result of such housing shortage are unable to find
decent, safe and sanitary housing at affordable rent levels.  Aware of the
difficulty in finding decent housing, some tenants attempt to pay requested
rent increases, but as a consequence must expend less on other necessities of
life.  This situation has had a detrimental effect on substantial numbers of
renters in the City, especially creating hardships on senior citizens,
persons on fixed incomes and low and moderate income households.  This
problem reached crisis level in the summer of 1978 following the passage of
Proposition 13.



 



   At that time, the Council of the City of Los Angeles conducted hearings
and caused studies to be made on the feasibility and desirability of various
measures designed to address the problems created by the housing shortage.



 



   In August, 1978, pending development and adoption of measures designed
to alleviate the City’s housing crisis, Council adopted Ordinance No.
151,415 which temporarily rolled back recently imposed rent increases, and
prohibited most rent increases on residential rental properties for six
months. Ordinance No. 151,415 expires on April 30, 1979.



 



   This ordinance has successfully reduced the rate of rent increases in
the City, along with the concomitant hardships and displacements.  However,
a housing shortage still exists within the City of Los Angeles and total
deregulation of rents at this time would immediately lead to widespread
exorbitant rent increases, and recurrence of the crisis, problems and
hardships which existed prior to the adoption of the moratorium measure.



 



   Therefore, it is necessary and reasonable to regulate rents so as to
safeguard tenants from excessive rent increases, while at the same time
providing landlords with just and reasonable returns from their rental units.
In order to assure compliance with the provisions of this chapter violations
of any of the provisions of this chapter may be raised as affirmative
defenses in unlawful detainer proceedings.  (Amended by Ord. No. 166,130,
Eff. 9/16/90.)

   (e)   The rental unit is vacated as a result of the termination of
the regulation of the rental unit under any local, state or federal program;



 



   (f)   The rental unit is the subject of a notice of noncompliance
sent to the Franchise Tax Board pursuant to Section 17274 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code, and the violations that were the subject of the notice have
not been corrected;



 



   (g)   If the rental unit is the subject of a notice of acceptance
into the Rent Escrow Account Program issued pursuant to Section 162.00, et
seq., of this Code, until the unit is removed from the Rent Escrow Account
Program and for one year thereafter, or until expiration of the period called
for under Section 161.807, if applicable, whichever is later, the property

   D.   For a rental unit which at any time on or after the operative
date of this chapter has not had a rent increase for a period of 12
consecutive months or more (other than one lawfully imposed pursuant to
Section 3.B.(5) or (6) of Ordinance No. 151,415, as amended), and/or pursuant
to Subsection E. of this section and/or pursuant to Section 151.07 of this
chapter:  (Amended by Ord. No. 184,822, Eff. 4/30/17.)



 



   The maximum rent or maximum adjusted rent may be increased in an amount
based on the Consumer Price Index – All Urban Consumers averaged for the
twelve (12) month period ending September 30, of each year, as determined and
published by the Department on or before May 30, of each year, pursuant to

any annual rent increase which first becomes effective on or before July 1,
through June 30, of each year.  If the landlord pays all the costs of
electricity and/or gas services for a rental unit then the maximum rent or
maximum adjusted rent may be increased an additional one percent (1%) for
each such service paid by the landlord, not to exceed a total of two percent
(2%).  If a rent increase had been imposed pursuant to Subsection A., B., C.
or F.1., of this section, then no rent increase may be imposed pursuant to
this subsection until twelve (12) consecutive months or more have elapsed
since such rent increase.  (Amended by Ord. No. 159,908, Eff. 6/30/85 Oper.
7/1/85.)



 



   EXCEPTION:  (Amended by Ord. No. 170,445, Eff. 5/6/95, Oper. 7/5/95.)



 



   This subsection shall not apply in the following circumstances:



 



   If the rental unit is the subject of a notice of noncompliance sent to
the Franchise Tax Board pursuant to Section 17274 of the Revenue and Taxation
Code, and the violations that were the subject of the Notice have not been
corrected; or



 



   If the rental unit is the subject of a notice of rent reduction or a
Notice of Acceptance issued pursuant to this chapter, and the conditions that
caused the placement have not been corrected; or



 



   If the rental unit is the subject of a criminal conviction related to
the landlord’s failure to comply with a citation or order issued by the
Department of Building and Safety, Fire Department, or Department of Health
with respect to the subject rental unit, and the conditions that caused the
conviction have not been corrected.



 



   E.   (Amended by Ord. No. 154,808, Eff. 2/13/81.) For a rental unit
which had an automatic rent adjustment between May 1, 1980 and August 31,
1980, inclusive, and for which the landlord pays all the costs of electricity
and/or gas services for a rental unit:



 



   The maximum rent or maximum adjusted rent may be increased 1% for each
such service paid by the landlord.  A landlord may not increase rent
pursuant to this subsection on or after May 1, 1981.



 



   F.   (Added by Ord. No. 158,891, Eff. 6/4/84.) For a rental unit,
which is the site within a mobilehome park (hereafter “site”) on which a
mobilehome is located and is vacated by all the tenants after the operative
date of this subsection;



 



   1.   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, if the
mobilehome on the site is vacated voluntarily or as a result of an eviction
or termination of tenancy based on one or more of the grounds described in
Section 151.09 A.1., A.2. or A.9., and the mobilehome is permanently removed
from the site, then the maximum rent or maximum adjusted rent may be
increased to any amount upon the re-rental of the site.  Thereafter, as long
as the site continues to be rented to one or more of the same persons, no
other rent increase shall be imposed pursuant to this subdivision.



 



   However, this subdivision shall not apply in the following
circumstances:

   b.   If the mobilehome has been replaced with a new mobilehome that
one or more of the same tenants will occupy.



 



   2.   If the site is voluntarily vacated by all the tenants as a
result of a sale of the mobilehome, and the mobilehome is not removed from
the site, then the maximum rent or maximum adjusted rent may be increased by
an amount not to exceed the rent on any existing comparable site in the park,
or ten percent (10%), whichever is the lower.  A comparable site for the
purposes of this subdivision shall be a site within the same park which has a
mobilehome located on it which is substantially the same size (single, double
or triple wide) as the mobilehome that was sold. Thereafter, as long as the
site continues to be rented to one or more of the same persons, no other rent
increase shall be imposed pursuant to this subdivision.  The rent may only
be increased pursuant to this subdivision once in any twelve consecutive
month period.



 



   G.   (Amended by Ord. No. 181,744, Eff. 7/15/11.)  For a rental
unit which has an additional tenant joining the occupants of the rental unit
thereby resulting in an increase in the number of tenants existing at the
inception of the tenancy:



 



   (a)   The  landlord may increase the maximum rent or maximum
adjusted rent by an amount not to exceed 10% for each additional tenant that
joins the occupants of the rental unit, except as follows:



 



   (i)   This Subsection shall not apply if the landlord had actual or
constructive knowledge of the additional tenant's occupancy of the rental
unit for more than 60 days and has failed to notify the tenant of the
increase pursuant to this Subsection;



 



   (ii)   If the additional tenant joined the occupants of the rental
unit prior to the effective date of this amendment and the landlord had
actual or constructive knowledge of the additional tenant's occupancy of the
rental unit prior to the effective date of this amendment, the landlord shall
not be able to increase the rent pursuant to this Subsection unless the
landlord had notified the tenant of the increase within 60 days of the
effective date of this amendment;



 



   (iii)   This Subsection shall not apply for the first minor
dependent child (or first minor dependent children of a multiple birth) added
to an existing tenancy.



 



   (b)   The rental unit shall not be eligible for a rent increase
until the additional tenant has maintained residence in the rental unit for a
minimum of thirty consecutive days.



 



 



SEC. 151.06.02.  PAYMENT OF INTEREST ON SECURITY DEPOSITS.



   (Added by Ord. No. 166,368, Eff. 12/6/90.)



 



   A.   Security deposit is defined in Section 1950.5 of the California
Civil Code.



 



   B.   (Amended by Ord. No. 174,017, Eff. 7/16/01.)  A landlord who
is subject to the provisions of Section 1950.5 of the California Civil Code
shall pay annually interest on all security deposits held for at least one
year for his or her tenants as follows:



 



   1.   (Amended by Ord. No. 175,020, Eff. 2/1/03.)  Beginning January
1, 2003, the landlord may determine the annual rate of interest by either of
the following methods:



 



   (a)   Using the annual rate of interest established by the Rent
Adjustment Commission (RAC).  That rate shall be based on the average of the
interest rates on savings accounts paid on September 1 of the previous year,
by at least five Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insured banks
with branches in Los Angeles.  RAC shall adopt the rate by November 30 of
each year and shall publish that rate in a newspaper of general circulation
within one week after it is established each year.  The interest rate
established by the RAC shall be the rate in effect from January 1 through
December 31 of the subsequent year.



 



   (b)   Using the actual interest earned on each security deposit
account each year.  If the landlord chooses this method of determining the
amount of interest due at the time of payment of the security deposit
interest, the landlord shall provide the tenant with bank statements
indicating the amount of interest earned on the security deposit for that
year.  In the event the landlord fails to provide that information to the
tenant at the time it transmits payment of the interest to the tenant, the
interest rate required to be paid, shall be the rate set by RAC.



 



   (c)   No interest shall accrue on security deposits for the period
of January 1, 2002 through December 31, 2002.



 



   2.   The annual interest rate shall be 2% simple interest per annum
for tenants’ security deposits held during the period of January 1, 2001,
through December 31, 2001.



 



   3.   The annual interest rate shall be 5% simple interest per annum
for tenants’ security deposits held during the period of November 1, 1990,
through December 31, 2000.



 



   4.   The Housing and Community Investment Department ("HCID") shall
identify the established interest rate in the annual rental unit registration
billings mailed to landlords.  HCID shall publish the established interest
rate in a newspaper of general circulation.  (Amended by Ord. No. 182,718,
Eff. 10/30/13.)



 



   C.   (Amended by Ord. No. 174,017, Eff. 7/16/01.)  Interest shall
begin accruing on November 1, 1990, on a monthly basis.  A tenant shall be
given the unpaid accrued interest in the form of either a direct payment or a
credit against the tenant’s rent.  The landlord shall choose between these
two methods of payment and notify the tenant in writing of his or her
choice.  The landlord may elect to pay the accrued interest on a monthly or
yearly basis.



 



   D.   Upon termination of tenancy, only the tenant whose security
deposit has been held for one year or more shall be entitled to payment of
any unpaid accumulated interest on the security deposit.  Such payment shall
be made at the same time and in the same manner as required for return of
security deposits in California Civil Code Section 1950.5(f).



 



   E.   Upon termination of a landlord’s interest in a property, all
accumulated interest on security deposits shall be disposed of in the same
manner as required for security deposits by California Civil Code Sections
1950.5(g) and (h).



 



   F.   Nothing herein shall preclude a landlord from exercising his or
her discretion in investing security deposits.



 



   G.   In the event the landlord fails to pay interest on the security
deposit as provided in this section, the tenant may bring an action for
recovery of the amount owed in a court of the appropriate jurisdiction
including, but not limited to, small claims court.



 



   H.   The provisions of this section shall not govern mobile home
parks.



 



 



SEC. 151.06.1.  SMOKE DETECTORS.



   (Added by Ord. No. 154,808, Eff. 2/1/81.)



 



   A.   For a rental unit in which the landlord installs smoke
detectors pursuant to Section 91.8603.1.1 or Section 91.8603.1.2 or Section
91.8603.2.1 or Section 91.8603.2.2 of this Code:  (Amended by Ord. No.
181,744, Eff. 7/15/11.)



 



   The rent may be increased 50 cents ($.50) per month for each battery
operated smoke detector installed in the rental unit, or three dollars ($3)
per month for each permanently installed smoke detector in the rental unit,
or the landlord may apply for a rent adjustment pursuant to Subsection A of
Section 151.07 of this chapter.  This surcharge shall not constitute a rent
increase for purposes of Section 151.06 of this chapter.



 



   B.   This rent surcharge may be collected at the above rate until
the actual cost to the landlord of purchase and installation has been
recovered.  This subsection shall not apply to a rental unit which becomes
eligible for a rent increase pursuant to Section 151.06 C. of this chapter
subsequent to the installation of the smoke detector.  The Commission shall
promulgate regulations on what constitutes eligible expenses in computing
such actual cost.



 



   C.   Within two months after installation, or by May 31, 1981,
whichever is later, the landlord must give written notice to the tenant
paying the surcharge of the actual purchase and installation costs of the
smoke detector and the month and year when said costs will have been
completely amortized.



 



 



SEC. 151.06.2.  SURCHARGE FOR WATER CONSERVATION ASSESSMENT.



   (Added by Ord. No. 166,707, Eff. 4/1/91.)



 



   If a landlord is assessed financial penalties pursuant to the Emergency
Water Conservation Plan of the City of Los Angeles, the landlord is entitled
to partially pass through those penalties to tenants in the form of a
temporary rent surcharge.  This surcharge shall not constitute a rent
increase for purposes of Section 151.06 of this chapter.



 



   A.   A landlord may partially pass through the financial penalties
assessed by the Department of Water and Power under the Emergency Water
Conservation Plan in the following amount and manner, and in accordance with
the regulations adopted by the Rent Adjustment Commission.



 



   1.   The landlord shall be entitled to a rent increase in the form
of a surcharge of fifty percent (50%) of the penalties assessed.



 



   2.   For mobilehome parks that are not separately submetered, the
owner of the mobilehome park shall be entitled to pass through seventy-five
percent (75%) of the assessed penalties.  For mobilehome parks that are
submetered, the owner of the park may apportion any assessed penalties in
accordance with Rent Adjustment Commission regulations.



 



   B.   A landlord shall not close on-premises coin operated laundry
facilities during the duration of the Emergency Water Conservation Plan.



 



 



SEC. 151.06.5.  REDUCTIONS IN RENT.



   (Repealed by Ord. No. 173,810, Eff. 4/16/01.)



 



 



SEC. 151.07.  AUTHORITY OF THE DEPARTMENT AND THE COMMISSION TO GRANT
INDIVIDUAL RENT ADJUSTMENTS.



 



   A.   Authority of the Department.



 



   1.   The Department, in accordance with such regulations and
guidelines as the Commission may establish, shall have the authority to grant
adjustments in the rent for a rental unit or units located in the same
housing complex upon receipt of an application for an adjustment filed by the
landlord of the unit or units if it finds that one or more of the grounds set
forth in this Subdivision exist.  Nothing in this Section shall prevent the
Department from granting rent adjustments under more than one provision of
this Section, provided the rent adjustments are for different work or
improvements.  The Department shall not grant a rent adjustment for a rental
unit under more than one provision of this Section for the same work or
improvement.  The Department shall not process any applications for rent
adjustments under this Section if the landlord has not paid all outstanding
fees imposed pursuant to Section 151.05, Section 161.352 and Section 161.901
of this Code.  (Amended by Ord. No. 184,080, Eff. 2/19/16.)



 



   a.   That on or after April 1, 1978, the landlord has completed a
capital improvement with respect to a rental unit and has not increased the
rent to reflect the cost of such improvement. If the Department so finds, the
landlord shall be entitled to a permanent monthly rent increase of 1/60th the
average per unit capital improvement cost; provided, however, any rent
adjustment for a capital improvement granted by the Department between
February 13, 1981, and May 31, 1982, shall terminate after five (5) years.



 



   Except that, for any capital improvement work for which a rent increase
application is filed with the Department on or after October 1, 1989 the
landlord shall only be entitled to a temporary monthly rent increase of
1/60th of fifty percent (50%) of the average per unit capital improvement
cost for a period not to exceed six (6) years.



 



   This temporary monthly surcharge shall not exceed $55.00 per month for
each rental unit unless agreed upon in writing by a landlord and a tenant. If
the surcharge, as calculated under the above formula, would exceed $55.00 per
month, then the surcharge period of six (6) years may be extended until the
allowable capital improvement expenses are recovered. This surcharge shall
not be included as part of the Maximum Adjusted Rent for purposes of
calculating the automatic rent adjustment pursuant to Section 151.06 D.



 



   Any capital improvement rent increase or surcharge approved by the
Department shall terminate if the Department determines that there has been a
complete failure of a capital improvement. The Commission may adopt
regulations to implement this provision.



 



   For the purposes of this provision, Seismic Retrofit Work shall not
qualify as a Capital Improvement.



 



   EXCEPTION:



 



   This paragraph shall not apply in the following circumstances:



 



   If the rental unit is the subject of a notice of noncompliance sent to
the Franchise Tax Board pursuant to Section 17274 of the Revenue and Taxation
Code, and the work is to correct the violations that were the subject of the
Notice.



 



   If the rental unit is the subject of a notice of rent reduction or a
notice of acceptance into the Rent Escrow Account Program issued pursuant to
Section 162.00, et seq. of this Code, and the work is to correct the
conditions that caused the placement.



 



   If the rental unit is the subject of a criminal conviction related to
the landlord's failure to comply with a citation or order issued by the
Department, the Department of Building and Safety, Fire Department, or
Department of Health with respect to the subject rental unit, and the work is
to correct the conditions that caused the conviction.



 



   b.   That on or after April 1, 1978, the landlord has completed
rehabilitation work with respect to a rental unit and has not increased the
rent to reflect the cost of the improvement.  If the Department so finds,
the landlord shall be entitled to a permanent monthly rent increase of 1/60th
of the average per unit rehabilitation cost; provided, however, any
rehabilitation work begun prior to June 1, 1982, shall be entitled to rent
increases of 1/36 of the average per unit rehabilitation cost.  Moreover,
any rental adjustment for rehabilitation work granted by the Department
between February 13, 1981 and May 31, 1982, shall terminate after 3 years.



 



   Except that, for any rehabilitation work for which a rent increase
application is filed with the Department on or after January 1, 1999, the
landlord shall only be entitled to a temporary monthly rent increase of
1/60th of the average per unit rehabilitation cost for a period not to exceed
five years, provided, however, where the landlord has obtained a
rehabilitation loan, the landlord shall only be entitled to a temporary
monthly rent increase amortized over the life of the loan which is calculated
based only on the loan's principal.



 



   This temporary monthly surcharge shall not exceed $75.00 per month or
10% of the Maximum Adjusted Rent, whichever is less, for each rental unit
unless agreed upon in writing by a landlord and a tenant.  If the surcharge,
as calculated under the above formula, would exceed $75.00 per month or 10%
of the Maximum Adjusted Rent, whichever is less, then the surcharge period of
five years may be extended until the allowable rehabilitation expenses are
recovered.  If the landlord receives a loan made with public funds to do the
rehabilitation work, and that loan allows for deferment of the loan
repayment, the surcharge shall also be deferred for the same amount of
time.  This surcharge shall not be included as part of the Maximum Adjusted
Rent for purposes of calculating the automatic rent adjustment pursuant to
Section 151.06 D.



 



   Any rehabilitation rent increase or surcharge approved by the
Department shall terminate if the Department determines that there has been a
complete failure of the rehabilitation work.  The Commission may adopt
regulations to implement this provision.



 



   For the purposes of this Paragraph, work required for compliance with
Section 91.8805 of this Code shall not be eligible as rehabilitation work.



 



   For the purposes of this provision, Seismic Retrofit Work shall not
qualify as Rehabilitation Work.



 



   c.   That on or after the effective date of this amendment, the
landlord has completed Primary Renovation Work and any Related Work in
conformance with a Tenant Habitability Plan accepted by the Department and
has not increased the rent to reflect the cost of such improvement.  For the
purposes of this provision, any portion of the Primary Renovation Work and
Related Work paid for with public funds is not eligible for this monthly rent
increase until the landlord is immediately obligated to repay the public
funds.



 



   If the Department so finds, the landlord shall be entitled to a
permanent monthly rent increase that shall not exceed the lesser of:



 



   (i)   100% of the Average Per Unit Primary Renovation Work Cost
amortized in accordance with a term schedule established by the Commission
and an interest rate corresponding to the monthly composite rate for average
yields from the sale of ten-year constant maturity U.S. government securities
plus one full percentage point; or



 



   (ii)   10% of the Maximum Adjusted Rent at the time an application
for a rent increase was filed.



 



   The maximum 10% rent increase permissible under this provision may be
imposed no more than once during the tenancy of any tenant household with an
annual income at or below 80% of the Area Median Income as established by the
U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development for the Los Angeles-Long
Beach primary metropolitan statistical area.  For all other tenants, the
Commission may promulgate regulations with respect to the number of times
during any tenancy that the maximum 10% rent increase may be imposed.



 



   For the purposes of this provision, costs associated with Primary
Renovation Work shall include the documented incurred costs for Primary
Renovation Work, Related Work, and temporary relocation of tenants undertaken
in accordance with an accepted Tenant Habitability Plan.



 



   Any rent increase granted pursuant to this provision shall be imposed
in two equal increments over a two-year period.  Upon receipt of the
Department's approval of a primary renovation rent increase, the landlord may
impose the first increment after providing notice to each affected tenant
pursuant to Section 827 of the California Civil Code.  The second increment
may be imposed no earlier than 12 calendar months after the first increment
is imposed and after providing notice to each affected tenant pursuant to
Section 827 of the California Civil Code.



 



   For the purposes of this provision, Seismic Retrofit Work shall not
qualify as Primary Renovation Work.



 



   EXCEPTION:



 



   This paragraph shall not apply in the following circumstances:



 



   If the rental unit is the subject of a notice of noncompliance sent to
the Franchise Tax Board pursuant to Section 17274 of the Revenue and Taxation
Code, and the work is to correct the violations that were the subject of the
Notice.



 



   If the rental unit is the subject of a notice of rent reduction or a
Notice of Acceptance into the Rent Escrow Account Program issued pursuant to
Section 162.00, et seq. of this Code, and the work is to correct the
conditions that caused the placement.



 



   If the rental unit is the subject of a criminal conviction related to
the landlord's failure to comply with a citation or order issued by the
Department, the Department of Building and Safety, Fire Department, or
Department of Health with respect to the subject rental unit, and the work is
to correct the conditions that caused the conviction.



 



   If the rental unit is the subject of a citation or order from a
government agency to abate hazardous materials and the citation or order is
issued before the acceptance of a Tenant Habitability Plan by the Department.



 



   d.   That on or after the effective date of this amendment, the
landlord has completed Seismic Retrofit Work and any Related Work in
conformance with a Tenant Habitability Plan accepted or waived by the
Department and has not increased the rent to reflect the cost of such
improvement. For the purposes of this provision, any portion of the Seismic
Retrofit Work and Related Work paid for with public funds is not eligible for
this monthly rent increase until the landlord is immediately obligated to
repay the public funds.



 



   If the Department so finds, the landlord shall be entitled to a
temporary monthly rent surcharge that shall be 50% of the Average Per Unit
Seismic Retrofit Work Cost amortized over 120 months in accordance with a
term schedule established by the Commission and an interest rate
corresponding to the monthly composite rate for average yields from the sale
of ten-year constant maturity U.S. government securities plus one full
percentage point; provided, however, that any rent adjustment for Seismic
Retrofit Work granted by the Department shall terminate after ten (10) years.



 



   Except that a temporary monthly rent surcharge shall not exceed $38.00
per month for each rental unit unless agreed upon in writing by and between a
landlord and a tenant. If the temporary monthly rent surcharge, as calculated
under the above formulas, would exceed $38.00 per month, then the temporary
monthly rent surcharge period of ten (10) years may be extended until the
allowable Seismic Retrofit Work expenses are recovered. This temporary
monthly rent surcharge shall not be included as part of the Maximum Adjusted
Rent for purposes of calculating the automatic rent adjustment pursuant to
Subsection D. of Section 151.06.



 



   For the purposes of this provision, costs associated with Seismic
Retrofit Work shall include the documented incurred costs for Seismic
Retrofit Work, Related Work, and temporary relocation of tenants undertaken
in accordance with an accepted Tenant Habitability Plan.



 



   For the purposes of this provision, if a landlord obtains and/or
receives, at any time, compensation for any portion of the money spent on
Seismic Retrofit Work, including, but not limited to, insurance,
court-awarded damages, federal or state subsidies, grants, cash rebates, and
federal or state tax credits (other than tax deductions and depreciation),
this compensation must be deducted from the cost (or remaining cost) of the
Seismic Retrofit Work before amortizing the costs among the units.



 



   EXCEPTION:



 



   This paragraph shall not apply in the following circumstances:



 



   If the rental unit is the subject of a notice of noncompliance sent to
the Franchise Tax Board pursuant to Section 17274 of the Revenue and Taxation
Code, and the work is to correct the violations that were the subject of the
Notice.



 



   If the rental unit is the subject of a notice of rent reduction or a
Notice of Acceptance into the Rent Escrow Account Program issued pursuant to
Section 162.00, et seq. of this Code, and the work is to correct the
conditions that caused the placement.



 



   If the rental unit is the subject of a criminal conviction related to
the landlord's failure to comply with a citation or order issued by the
Department, the Department of Building and Safety, Fire Department, or
Department of Health with respect to the subject rental unit, and the work is
to correct the conditions that caused the conviction.



 



   If the rental unit is the subject of a citation or order from a
government agency to abate hazardous materials and the citation or order is
issued before the acceptance of a Tenant Habitability Plan by the Department.



 



   2.   Procedures for Departmental Review of Adjustment Requests. 
(Amended by Ord. No. 184,080, Eff. 2/19/16.)



 



   a.   Applications.  An application for a rent adjustment under this
subsection shall be made within twelve months after the completion of the
work.  The application shall be filed with the Department upon a form and
with the number of copies prescribed by the Department and shall include,
among other things, the addresses and unit numbers of the unit or units for
which an adjustment was requested.  If the rent adjustment request is the
result of the same Capital Improvement, Primary Renovation Work, Seismic
Retrofit Work, or Rehabilitation Work, the application may include all rental
units in a housing complex for which an application for a rent increase is
filed.



 



   The applicant shall produce at the request of the Department such
records, receipts or reports as the Department may deem necessary to make a
determination on the adjustment request.  Failure to produce requested items
shall be sufficient basis to terminate the rent adjustment proceedings.  All
applications shall be accompanied by a declaration stating that the above
information is true and correct.



 



   An application for a rent adjustment under this subsection shall be
accompanied by a $25.00 filing fee.  The landlord shall not recover this
filing fee from any tenant.  The requirement to pay this fee shall not apply
to the first application for the housing complex made by a landlord within a
calendar year pursuant to this subsection.



 



   b.   Notice.  Upon receipt of a completed rent adjustment
application under the provisions of Subsections a., b., c., d., or e. of
Section 151.07(A)(1) of this Code, the Department shall notify the tenant or
tenants of the subject unit or units by mail of the receipt of such
application, the amount of the requested rent increase, the landlord's
justification for the request, a tenant's right to submit written objections
to the adjustment request within 10 days of the date of mailing such notice,
and of the address to which the objections may be mailed or delivered.



 



   c.   The Department shall, within 60 days of the receipt of a
completed application, make a determination on the application for rent
adjustment.  The determination shall be either to approve, modify, or
disapprove the requested rent adjustment.  Copies of the findings and
determination of the Department shall be mailed by the Department to the
applicant and all affected tenants.  Said findings and determination shall
provide that any rent increases approved on or after January 1, 1981 for
capital improvements, rehabilitation work begun prior to June 1, 1982, or
Seismic Retrofit Work shall not be included as part of the Maximum Adjusted
Rent for purposes of computing rent increases pursuant to Section 151.06 of
this chapter.



 



   3.   Requests for Hearing.



 



   a.   The determination of the Department shall be final unless a
request for hearing is filed by or on behalf of the applicant or an affected
tenant, and such request is received by the Department within 15 days after
the mailing of the findings and determination. A request for hearing shall be
in writing and filed in the office of the Department upon a form and with the
number of copies required by the Department. Each request for hearing shall
be accompanied by a filing fee in the amount of $35.00. (Amended by Ord. No.
164,167, Eff. 12/12/88.)



 



   b.   A request for hearing shall set forth specifically, wherein the
requesting party believes there was error or abuse of discretion by the
Department in ruling on the application for a rent increase.  Additionally,
a request for hearing may be made based on new, relevant information which
was not submitted to the Department at the time of the initial determination
due to mistake, surprise, inadvertence, or excusable neglect, and which
information would have affected the determination of the Department if it had
been submitted earlier.  The filing of a request for hearing by a tenant or
tenants will not stay the effect of the determination of the Department. 
However, any increase collected by the landlord pursuant to the
Department’s determination but not approved by the hearing officer shall be
forthwith refunded by the landlord to the tenant or tenants from whom such
rent increases were collected, or offset by the landlord against the next
legally due rental payment. (Amended by Ord. No. 156,597, Eff. 5/20/82, Oper.
5/15/82.)



 



   c.   If a request for hearing is received by the Department within
the 15 day period, then the requested hearing shall be held within 30 days of
the receipt of the request by a hearing officer designated by the
Department.  Notice of the time, date and place of the hearing shall be
mailed by the Department to the applicant and tenants of the subject rental
units at least 10 days prior to the hearing date.  (Amended by Ord. No.
156,597, Eff. 5/20/82, Oper. 5/15/82.)



 



   d.   The hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer designated
by the Department.  At the time of the hearing the landlord and/or any
affected tenant may offer such documents, testimony, written declarations or
evidence as may be pertinent to the proceedings.



 



   e.   In making a determination on an application for rent increase,
the designated hearing officer shall make a written determination upholding,
reversing or modifying the determination of the Department.  If the
determination is to reverse or modify the determination of the Department,
the hearing officer shall specifically set forth the reasons or such reversal
or modification.



 



   f.   Time Limit.  A final decision shall be made by the hearing
officer within 45 days of the termination of the time for filing of a request
for hearing.  The Department shall mail copies of the findings and
determination of the hearing officer to the applicant and all affected
tenants.  Said findings and determination shall provide that any rent
increases approved on or after January 1, 1981 for capital improvements or
rehabilitation work begun prior to June 1, 1982 shall not be included as part
of the maximum adjusted rent for purposes of computing rent increases
pursuant to Section 151.06 of this chapter.  (Amended by Ord. No. 156,597,
Eff. 5/20/82, Oper. 5/15/82.)



 



   4.   Limitation on Rent Adjustment.  (Added by Ord. No. 154,808,
Eff. 2/13/81.)



 



   a.   (Amended by Ord. No. 156,597, Eff. 5/20/82, Oper. 5/15/82.) For
every rental unit which experiences a rent increase based on capital
improvement and/or rehabilitation work begun prior to June 1, 1982 and also
approved by the Department after February 13, 1981:



 



   The Department shall mail a notice to the landlord of the rental unit
indicating that the Department will issue a written order to the landlord
requiring the termination of the rent increase after the cost of the work has
been fully recovered, unless it determines that the rental unit became
eligible for a rent increase pursuant to Section 151.06 C. or that a
reduction in rent would work an undue hardship on the landlord.



 



   b.   An application for relief from the proposed order may be made
within 30 days after the mailing of the notice in accordance with such
procedures as the Commission may establish.



 



   c.   For any rental unit for which a capital improvement rent
adjustment was granted by the Department between February 13, 1981 and May
31, 1982, and for which a hardship exemption was granted pursuant to Section
151.07 A.4.a., said capital improvement rent adjustment shall terminate upon
the effective date of this amendment. The landlord shall, within ten days of
the effective date of this amendment, serve a written notice of termination
of the capital improvement rent adjustment to all affected tenants setting
forth the amount of increase which is to be terminated.  (Added by Ord. No.
163,832, Eff. 8/25/88.)



 



   5.   The Department in accordance with such guidelines as the
Commission may establish, shall have the authority to grant certificates of
exemptions for luxury housing accommodations and substantial renovation work
In processing an application for exemption, the Department shall afford both
landlords and tenants notice and an opportunity to be heard prior to the
issuance of a certificate of exemption. An application for a certificate of
exemption shall be accompanied by a $25.00 filing fee. After August 31, 1982,
no unit shall be exempt pursuant to Sections 151.02 M.7. or M.8. without
first obtaining a certificate of exemption. Pending completion of the
processing of an application for a certificate of exemption, the Department
may issue a temporary certificate of exemption for housing accommodations.
(Amended by Ord. No. 164,167, Eff. 12/12/88.)



 



   6.   (Subdiv. 6 Added by Ord. No. 159,908, Eff. 6/30/85, Oper.
7/1/85.) On or before May 30, of each year, the Department shall publish in a
newspaper of general circulation the annual rent increase adjustment for any
rent increase imposed pursuant to Section 151.06 D. of this chapter for the
following twelve (12) month period beginning on July 1 and ending on June
30.  The Department shall calculate this adjustment as follows:



 



   The annual rent increase adjustment shall be based on the Consumer
Price Index – All Urban Consumers for the Los Angeles-Long
Beach-Anaheim-SMSA averaged for the previous twelve (12) month period ending
September 30 of each year.  It shall reflect the change in the Consumer
Price Index over the previous consecutive twelve (12) month period expressed
as a percentage and rounded off to the nearest whole number.  If the
calculated adjustment is three percent (3%) or less, the Department shall set
the annual rent increase adjustment at three percent (3%) but, if the
calculated adjustment is eight percent (8%) or greater, the Department shall
set the annual rent increase adjustment at eight percent (8%).



 



   7.   Re-rental Certificates.  (Repealed by Ord. No. 176,544, Eff.
5/2/05.)



 



   8.   The Commission shall promulgate regulations to establish the
health, safety, and habitability standards which shall be followed for any
Capital Improvement, Primary Renovation Work, Seismic Retrofit Work, Related
Work, or Rehabilitation Work performed while a tenant is residing in the
rental unit.  These regulations shall include, but not be limited to,
provisions regarding advanced notification, security, fire standards, pest
control, the operation of dangerous equipment, utility interruptions, the use
of potentially dangerous construction materials, and the protection of
tenants and their property from exposure to natural elements.  (Amended by
Ord. No. 184,080, Eff. 2/19/16.)



 



   9.   The Commission shall have the authority to adopt any
regulations necessary to implement this section.  (Added by Ord. No.
184,080, Eff. 2/19/16.)



 



   B.   Authority of the Commission and Hearing Officers.



 



   1.   (Amended by Ord. No. 156,597, Eff. 5/20/82, Oper. 5/15/82.) A
designated hearing officer shall have the authority, in accordance with such
guidelines as the Commission may establish, to grant increases in the rent
for a rental unit, or for two or more rental units located in the same
housing complex, upon receipt of an application for adjustment filed by the
landlord and after notice and hearing, if the hearing officer finds that such
increase is in keeping with the purposes of this chapter and that the maximum
rent or maximum adjusted rent otherwise permitted pursuant to this chapter
does not constitute a just and reasonable return on the rental unit or
units.  The following are factors, among other relevant factors as the
Commission may determine, which may be considered in determining whether a
rental unit yields a just and reasonable return:



 



   a.   property taxes;



 



   b.   reasonable operating and maintenance expenses;



 



   c.   the extent of capital improvements made to the building in
which the rental unit is located as distinguished from ordinary repair,
replacement and maintenance;



 



   d.   living space, and the level of housing services;



 



   e.   substantial deterioration of the rental units other than as a
result of ordinary wear and tear;



 



   f.   failure to perform ordinary repair, replacement and
maintenance; and



 



   g.   financing costs on the property if such financing was obtained
prior to June 1, 1978 and if it contains either a balloon payment or variable
rate provision.



 



   2.   Anti-Speculation Provision.  If the only justification offered
for the requested rent increase on the landlord’s application is an
assertion that the maximum rents or maximum adjusted rents permitted pursuant
to this chapter do not allow the landlord a return sufficient to pay both the
operating expenses and debt service on the rental unit or units or on the
housing complex containing the rental unit or units, a rent adjustment will
not be permitted pursuant to this subsection to a landlord who acquired an
interest in the rental unit or units after October 1, 1978.



 



   3.   Procedures.



 



   a.   An application for rent adjustment shall be submitted on a form
and with the number of copies prescribed by the Department and shall include
among other things the addresses and unit numbers of the unit or units for
which an adjustment is requested. Such application may include all rental
units in a housing complex for which a rent increase is requested. Each
application shall be accompanied by a $25.00 filing fee. An applicant shall
produce at the request of the Department or hearing officer to whom the
matter is assigned such records, receipts or reports as the Department or
hearing officer may deem necessary to make a determination on the adjustment
request. Failure to produce such requested items shall be sufficient basis
for the Department or hearing officer to terminate the rent adjustment
proceeding. All applications shall be accompanied by a declaration stating
that the above information is true and correct. (Amended by Ord. No. 164,167,
Eff. 12/12/88.)



 



   b.   Upon receipt of a completed application, the application shall
be referred by the Department to a hearing officer for processing and
determination.  The Department shall notify by mail the tenant or tenants of
the subject unit or units of the receipt of such application, the amount of
the requested rent increase, the landlord’s justification for the request,
and the place, date and time of the hearing on the adjustment request.  The
hearing shall be set no less than 10 days nor more than 45 days after the
date of mailing such notice.



 



   c.   The hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer designated
by the Department.  At the time of the hearing the landlord and/or any
affected tenant may offer such documents, testimony, written declarations or
evidence as may be pertinent to the proceedings.



 



   d.   A determination with written findings in support thereof shall
be made by the assigned hearing officer within 75 days from the date of the
filing of the application.  A rent adjustment may be granted for less than,
but for no more than the amount requested.



 



   e.   Copies of the findings and determination of the hearing officer
shall be mailed by the Department to the applicant and all affected
tenants.  The determination shall become final 15 days from the date of
mailing unless an appeal is filed with the Commission within such period.
(Amended by Ord. No. 156,597, Eff. 5/20/82, Oper. 5/15/82.)



 



   4.   Appeals.



 



   a.   Time and Manner.  An appeal to the Commission from the
determination of a hearing officer may be filed by the applicant or any
affected tenant pursuant to this subsection within 15 days after mailing of
such determination. Such appeals shall be in writing and shall be filed in
the office of the Department upon a form and with the number of copies
required by the Commission. Each appeal shall be accompanied by a $50.00
filing fee. An appeal shall set forth specifically wherein the appellant
believes there was an error or abuse of discretion by the hearing officer.
Additionally, an appeal may be made based on new, relevant information which
was not submitted to the hearing officer at the time of the initial
determination due to mistake, surprise, inadvertence, or excusable neglect,
and which information would have affected the determination of the hearing
officer if it had been submitted earlier. The filing of an appeal will not
stay the effect of the hearing officer’s determination. However, any rent
increases collected by the landlord pursuant to the hearing officer’s
determination but not approved on appeal shall be forthwith refunded to the
tenant or tenants from whom such rent increases were collected or offset
against the next legally due rental payment. (Amended by Ord. No. 164,167,
Eff. 12/12/88.)



 



   b.   Record on Appeal.  Upon receipt of an appeal, the entire
administrative record of the matter, including the appeal, shall be filed
with the Commission.  At any time prior to action on the appeal, the hearing
officer may submit to the Commission written comments pertaining to the
appeal.



 



   c.   Hearing Date and Notice.  Upon receipt of the appeal, the
Commission shall cause the matter to be set for hearing before three or more
Commissioners acting as an appeals board, and notice shall be given by mail
of the date, time, place and purpose thereof to the applicant and all
affected tenants.  Such notice shall be in writing and mailed at least 10
days prior to said hearing.  The appeals board shall make its determination
within 60 days after the expiration of the appeal period or within such
extended period of time as may be mutually agreed upon by the appellant and
the designated appeals board. (Amended by Ord. No. 156,597, Eff. 5/20/82,
Oper. 5/15/82.)



 



   d.   Determination.  If the appeals board fails to act within the
time limits specified in this section, the determination of the hearing
officer shall become final.  The decision on appeal shall be concurred in by
a majority of the appeals board.  The appeals board may affirm, modify or
reverse the determination of the hearing officer.  It may modify or reverse
such determination only upon making written findings setting forth
specifically either  (i)  wherein the action of the hearing officer was in
error or constituted an abuse of discretion, or  (ii)  the new information
not available at the time of the hearing upon which the appellant relies, and
supporting its own determination.  A copy of the findings and determination
shall be mailed to the applicant and to affected tenants.  (Amended by Ord.
No. 156,597, Eff. 5/20/82, Oper. 5/15/82.)



 



 



SEC. 151.08.  AUTHORITY OF COMMISSION TO REGULATE BY CLASS.



 



   A.   In addition to the authority contained in Section 151.07, the
Rent Adjustment Commission may make such adjustments, either upward or
downward, of the maximum rent or maximum adjusted rent for any class of
rental units as it determines are appropriate to carry out the purposes of
this chapter.  For the purposes of this section, the phrase “class of
rental units” may include all rental units or certain categories of rental
units based on such common characteristics as the Commission may determine,
including size, age, construction, rent, or geographic area.



 



   B.   The Commission shall promulgate regulations on what constitutes
corresponding reductions in rents in those instances where there is a
reduction of housing services, and on permissible rent increases where a
rental unit regularly experiences a seasonal fluctuation in rents.



 



   C.   For the purpose of adjusting rents under the provisions of this
section, the Commission may promulgate by regulation a schedule of standards
for permissible rental increases, or required decreases related to the
improvement, reduction, or deterioration in housing services or facilities,
or to increases or decreases in operating expenses and taxes.  A decrease in
operating expenses shall include a reclassification of the rate of the sewer
service charge from commercial rates to residential rates for master metered
mobilehome park residents.  (Amended by Ord. No. 168,353, Eff. 1/3/93.)



 



   D.   The Commission may promulgate regulations extending the
amortization period for rent adjustments granted by the Department pursuant
to Section 151.07 A. of this chapter, where the Capital Improvement, Seismic
Retrofit Work, and/or Rehabilitation Work has been funded or subsidized
through a federal, state or City housing program.  (Amended by Ord. No.
184,080, Eff. 2/19/16.)



 



   E.   The Commission shall promulgate regulations to determine the
appropriate maximum adjusted rent on a rental unit when the tenant of a
rental unit was, but no longer is, the resident manager, and when a rental
unit, formerly occupied by a resident manager, is offered for rent to another
person.  (Amended by Ord. No. 156,597, Eff. 5/20/82, Oper. 5/15/82.)



 



 



SEC. 151.09.  EVICTIONS.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 154,237, Eff. 8/30/80, Oper. 9/1/80.)



 



   A.   A landlord may bring an action to recover possession of a
rental unit only upon one of the following grounds:



 



   1.   The tenant has failed to pay rent to which the landlord is
entitled, including amounts due under Subsection F. of Section 151.05. 
(Amended by Ord. No. 186,448, Eff. 12/30/19.)



 



   2.   The tenant has violated a lawful obligation or covenant of the
tenancy and has failed to cure the violation after having received written
notice from the landlord, other than a violation based on:  (Amended by Ord.
No. 175,130, Eff. 3/31/03.)



 



   (a)   The obligation to surrender possession upon proper notice; or



 



   (b)   The obligation to limit occupancy, provided that the
additional tenant who joins the occupants of the unit thereby exceeding the
limits on occupancy set forth in the rental agreement is either the first or
second dependent child to join the existing tenancy of a tenant of record or
the sole additional adult tenant.  For purposes of this section, multiple
births shall be considered as one child.  The landlord, however, has the
right to approve or disapprove the prospective additional tenant, who is not
a minor dependent child, provided that the approval is not unreasonably
withheld; or



 



   (c)   A change in the terms of the tenancy that is not the result of
an express written agreement signed by both of the parties.  For purposes of
this section, a landlord may not unilaterally change the terms of the tenancy
under Civil Code Section 827 and then evict the tenant for the violation of
the added covenant unless the tenant has agreed in writing to the additional
covenant.  The tenant must knowingly consent, without threat or coercion, to
each change in the terms of the tenancy.  A landlord is not required to
obtain a tenant's written consent to a change in the terms of the tenancy if
the change in the terms of the tenancy is authorized by Los Angeles Municipal
Code Section 151.06, or if the landlord is required to change the terms of
the tenancy pursuant to federal, state, or local law.  Nothing in this
paragraph shall exempt a landlord from providing legally required notice of a
change in the terms of the tenancy.



 



   3.   (Amended by Ord. No. 180,449, Eff. 2/5/09.)  The tenant is
committing or permitting to exist a nuisance in or is causing damage to, the
rental unit or to the unit's appurtenances, or to the common areas of the
complex containing the rental unit, or is creating an unreasonable
interference with the comfort, safety, or enjoyment of any of the other
residents of the rental complex or within a 1,000 foot radius extending from
the boundary line of the rental complex.



 



   The term "nuisance" as used in this subdivision includes, but is not
limited to, any gang-related crime, violent crime, unlawful weapon or
ammunition crime or threat of violent crime, illegal drug activity, any
documented activity commonly associated with illegal drug dealing, such as
complaints of noise, steady traffic day and night to a particular unit,
barricaded units, possession of weapons, or drug loitering as defined in
Health and Safety Code Section 11532, or other drug related circumstances
brought to the attention of the landlord by other tenants, persons within the
community, law enforcement agencies or prosecution agencies.  For purposes
of this subdivision, gang-related crime is any crime motivated by gang
membership in which the perpetrator, victim or intended victim is a known
member of a gang.  Violent crime is any crime which involves use of a gun, a
deadly weapon or serious bodily injury and for which a police report has been
completed.  A violent crime under this subdivision shall not include a crime
that is committed against a person residing in the same rental unit as the
person committing the crime.  Unlawful weapon or ammunition crime is the
illegal use, manufacture, causing to be manufactured, importation,
possession, possession for sale, sale, furnishing, or giving away of
ammunition or any weapon listed in subdivision (c)(1)-(5) of Section 3485 of
the Civil Code.



 



   Threat of violent crime is any statement made by a tenant, or at his or
her request, by his or her agent to any person who is on the premises or to
the owner of the premises, or his or her agent, threatening the commission of
a crime which will result in death or great bodily injury to another person,
with the specific intent that the statement is to be taken as a threat, even
if there is no intent of actually carrying it out, when on its face and under
the circumstances in which it is made, it is so unequivocal, immediate and
specific as to convey to the person threatened, a gravity of purpose and an
immediate prospect of execution of the threat, and thereby causes that person
reasonably to be in sustained fear for his or her own safety or for his or
her immediate family's safety.  Such a threat includes any statement made
verbally, in writing, or by means of an electronic communication device and
regarding which a police report has been completed.  A threat of violent
crime under this section shall not include a crime that is committed against
a person who is residing in the same rental unit as the person making the
threat.  "Immediate family" means any spouse, whether by marriage or not,
parent, child, any person related by consanguinity of affinity within the
second degree, or any other person who regularly resides in the household, or
who, within the prior six months, regularly resided in the household. 
"Electronic communication device" includes but is not limited to, telephones,
cellular telephones, video recorders, fax machines, or pagers.  "Electronic
communications" has the same meaning as the term is defined in subsection 12
of Section 2510 of Title 18 of the United States Code, except that
"electronic communication" for purposes of this definition shall not be
limited to electronic communication that affects interstate or foreign
commerce.



 



   Illegal drug activity is a violation of any of the provisions of
Chapter 6 (commencing with Section 11350) or Chapter 6.5 (commencing with
Section 11400) of the Health and Safety Code.



 



   4.   The tenant is using, or permitting a rental unit, the common
areas of the rental complex containing the rental unit, or an area within a
1,000 foot radius from the boundary line of the rental complex to be used for
any illegal purpose.  (Amended by Ord. No. 171,442, Eff. 1/19/97.)



 



   The term "illegal purpose" as used in this subdivision includes, but is
not limited to, violations of any of the provisions of Division 10, Chapter 6
(commencing with Section 11350) and Chapter 6.5 (commencing with Section
11400) of the California Health and Safety Code, and does not include the use
of housing accommodations lacking a legal approved use or which have been
cited for occupancy or other housing code violations.  (Amended by Ord. No.
184,822, Eff. 4/30/17.)



 



   5.   The tenant, who had a written lease or rental agreement which
terminated on or after the effective date of this chapter, has refused, after
written request or demand by the landlord to execute a written extension or
renewal thereof for a further term of like duration with similar provisions
and in such terms as are not inconsistent with or violative of any provision
of this chapter or any other provision of law.



 



   6.   The tenant has refused the landlord reasonable access to the
unit for the purpose of making repairs or improvements, or for the purpose of
inspection as permitted or required by the lease or by law, or for the
purpose of showing the rental unit to any prospective purchaser or mortgagee.



 



   7.   The person in possession of the rental unit at the end of a
lease term is a subtenant not approved by the landlord.



 



   8.   (Amended by Ord. No. 180,747, Eff. 8/1/09.)  The landlord
seeks in good faith to recover possession of the rental unit for use and
occupancy as a primary place of residence by:



 



   (a)   The landlord; or



 



   (b)   The landlord's spouse, grandchildren, children, parents or
grandparents; or



 



   (c)   A resident manager.



 



   Landlords seeking to recover possession pursuant to the provisions of
this Subdivision must comply with the restrictions and requirements of
Section 151.30, as well as all other relevant provisions of this Article.



 



   9.   (Amended by Ord. No. 176,544, Eff. 5/2/05.)  The landlord,
having complied with all applicable notices and advisements required by law,
seeks in good faith to recover possession so as to undertake Primary
Renovation Work of the rental unit or the building housing the rental unit,
in accordance with a Tenant Habitability Plan accepted by the Department, and
the tenant is unreasonably interfering with the landlord's ability to
implement the requirements of the Tenant Habitability Plan by engaging in any
of the following actions:



 



   a.   The tenant has failed to temporarily relocate as required by
the accepted Tenant Habitability Plan; or



 



   b.   The tenant has failed to honor a permanent relocation agreement
with the landlord pursuant to Section 152.05 of this Code.



 



   10.   (Amended by Ord. No. 176,544, Eff. 5/2/05.)  The landlord
seeks in good faith to recover possession of the rental unit under either of
the following circumstances:



 



   a.   to demolish the rental unit; or



 



   b.   to remove the rental unit permanently from rental housing use.



 



   Landlords seeking to recover possession for either of the circumstances
described in this subdivision must comply with the requirements of Sections
151.22 through 151.28 of this article.  This subdivision constitutes lawful
grounds for eviction only where a landlord is withdrawing from rent or lease
all of the rental units in a structure or building.  A landlord seeking to
evict tenants pursuant to either of the circumstances described in this
subdivision may not withdraw from rent or lease less than all of the
accommodations in a structure or building.  Pursuant to California
Government Code Section 7060, this subdivision shall not apply to a
Residential Hotel as defined in accordance with California Health and Safety
Code Section 50519 and Section 47.70, et seq., of this Code.  (Amended by
Ord. No. 184,873, Eff. 6/4/17.)



 



   11.   The landlord seeks in good faith to recover possession of the
rental unit in order to comply with a governmental agency’s order to
vacate, order to comply, order to abate, or any other order that necessitates
the vacating of the building housing the rental unit as a result of a
violation of the Los Angeles Municipal Code or any other provision of law. 
(Amended by Ord. No. 172,288, Eff. 12/17/98.)



 



   12.   The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development is both the
owner and plaintiff and seeks to recover possession in order to vacate the
property prior to sale and has complied with all tenant notification
requirements under federal law and administrative regulations.  (Added by
Ord. No. 173,224, Eff. 5/11/00.)



 



   13.   The rental unit is in a Residential Hotel, and the landlord
seeks to recover possession of the rental unit in order to Convert or
Demolish the unit, as those terms are defined in Section 47.73 of the Los
Angeles Municipal Code.  A landlord may recover possession of a rental unit
pursuant to this paragraph only after the Department has approved an
Application for Clearance pursuant to the provisions of Section 47.78. 
(Amended by Ord. No. 180,175, Eff. 9/29/08.)



 



   14.   The landlord seeks to recover possession of the rental unit to
convert the subject property to an affordable housing accommodation in
accordance with an affordable housing exemption issued by the Department
pursuant to Section 151.02 of this Code.  If the landlord fails to record a
government imposed regulatory agreement within six months of the filing of
the affordable housing exemption with the Department in accordance with
Section 151.02 of this Code, and the landlord seeks to offer the rental unit
for rent or lease, the accommodations shall be offered and rented or leased
at the lawful rent in effect at the time the affordable housing exemption was
filed with the Department, plus annual adjustments available pursuant to
Section 151.06 of this Code.  Furthermore, the landlord shall first offer to
rent or lease the unit to the tenant(s) displaced from that unit pursuant to
this Subdivision, provided that the tenant(s) advised the landlord in writing
within 30 days of displacement of his or her desire to consider an offer to
renew the tenancy and provided the landlord with an address to which that
offer is to be directed.  The tenant(s) may subsequently advise the landlord
of a change of address to which an offer is to be directed.  A landlord who
re-offers the rental unit pursuant to the provisions of this Subdivision
shall deposit the offer in the United States mail, by registered or certified
mail with postage prepaid, addressed to the displaced tenant(s) at the
address furnished to the landlord as provided in this Subdivision, and shall
describe the terms of the offer.  The displaced tenant(s) shall have 30 days
from the deposit of the offer in the mail to accept the offer by personal
delivery of that acceptance to the Department or deposit of the acceptance in
the United States mail by registered or certified mail with postage
prepaid.  (Added by Ord. No. 181,744, Eff. 7/15/11.)



 



   B.   If the dominant intent of the landlord in seeking to recover
possession of a rental unit is retaliation against the tenant for exercising
his or her rights under this chapter or because of his or her complaint to an
appropriate agency as to tenantability of a rental unit, and if the tenant is
not in default as to the payment of rent, then the landlord may not recover
possession of a rental unit in any action or proceeding or cause the tenant
to quit involuntarily.  (Amended by Ord. No. 161,865, Eff. 1/19/87.)

landlord shall serve on the tenant a written notice setting forth the reasons
for the termination.  The written notice shall be as described in Civil Code
Section 1946 or Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1161 and 1161a.  The notice
shall be given in the manner prescribed by Code of Civil Procedure Section
1162 and must also comply with the following:  (Amended by Ord. No. 184,822,
Eff. 4/30/17.)

Procedure Section 1162 in lieu of the notice required in Subdivision 1. of
this Subsection.  When filing the declaration, the landlord shall pay an
administrative fee in the amount of $75.  The fee shall pay for the cost of
administering and enforcing the provisions of Section 151.30 of this Code.

article are in lieu of the notice required in Subdivision 1. of this

   D.   A landlord shall not change the terms of a tenancy to prohibit
pets and then evict the tenant for keeping a pet which was kept and allowed
prior to the change, unless the landlord can establish that the pet

below Area Median Income (AMI), as adjusted for household size, as defined by
the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, regardless of length of
tenancy.  Relocation fees owed for the termination of tenancy set forth in
Subdivision 14. shall be based on the applicable provisions of the Uniform
Relocation Act, California Relocation Assistance Act, or the amount set forth
in this section.  If more than one fee applies to a rental unit, the
landlord shall pay the highest of the applicable fees.  Tenants who claim
eligibility based on their income shall file a statement with the Department
verifying their income on a form prescribed by the Department.  Requests for
a hearing to appeal a decision regarding a tenant's relocation assistance
eligibility, including disputes about eligibility for higher relocation

   The Department shall charge a fee of $193 per rental unit for any
hearing request under this subsection to pay for the cost of the appeal
hearing.  For the year beginning July 1, 2009, and all subsequent years, the
fee amounts shall be adjusted on an annual basis pursuant to the formula set
forth in Section 151.06 D. of this Code.  The adjusted amount shall be
rounded to the nearest $50 increment.  (Amended by Ord. No. 184,822, Eff.
4/30/17.)



 



   If a termination of tenancy is required due to a governmental agency
order to vacate or comply, and the subject property has an approved use as a
single family home and the structure containing the single family home
contains two dwellings, the landlord shall pay a relocation fee in accordance
with Section 151.09 G. of this Code to the tenant(s) of the affected rental
unit(s) within 15 days of receiving notice from the tenant(s) of their
intention to terminate the tenancy.  (Amended by Ord. No. 184,822, Eff.
4/30/17.)



 



   1.   (Amended by Ord. No. 178,632, Eff. 5/26/07.)  This payment
shall be made as follows:



 



   a.   The entire fee shall be paid to a tenant who is the only tenant
in a rental unit;



 



   b.   If a rental unit is occupied by two or more tenants, then each
tenant of the unit shall be paid an equal, pro-rata share of the fee;



 



   c.   Nothing in this subsection relieves the landlord from the
obligation to provide relocation assistance pursuant to City administrative
agency action or any other provision of local, state or federal law.  If a
tenant is entitled to monetary relocation benefits pursuant to City
administrative agency action or any provision of local, state or federal law,
then those benefits shall operate as a credit against any fee required to be
paid to the tenant under this section.



 



   d.   If the termination of tenancy is based on the grounds set forth
in Subdivisions 8., 10., 11. or 12. of Subsection A. of this section, then
the landlord shall also pay the City a fee for the purpose of providing
relocation assistance by the City's Relocation Assistance Service Provider,
as defined in Sections 47.06 B. and 47.07 B. of this Code.  The fee shall be
$640 for each unit occupied by a qualified tenant and $400 for each unit
occupied by other tenants, and an additional $55 per unit to pay for the
administrative costs associated with this service.  The fees, set forth
above, may be increased in an amount based on the Consumer Price Index - All
Urban Consumers averaged for the first 12-month period ending September 30,
of each year, as determined and published by the Housing and Community
Investment Department on or before May 30, of each year, pursuant to Section
151.07 A.6. of this Code.  The Relocation Assistance Service Provider will
provide the relocation assistance services listed in Sections 47.06 D. and
47.07 D. of this Code.  (Amended by Ord. No. 182,718, Eff. 10/30/13.)



 



   2.   The landlord shall perform the acts described in this
subsection within fifteen days of service of a written notice of termination
described in California Civil Code Section 1946; provided, however, the
landlord may in its sole discretion, elect to pay the monetary relocation
benefits to be paid to a tenant pursuant to this subsection to an escrow
account to be disbursed to the tenant upon certification of vacation of the
rental housing unit. The escrow account shall provide for the payment prior
to vacation of all or a portion of the monetary relocation benefits for
actual relocation expenses incurred or to be incurred by the tenant prior to
vacation, including but not limited to security deposits, moving expense
deposits and utility connection charges.  Escrow accounts shall provide
that, in the event of disputes between the landlord and the tenant as to the
release of funds from escrow, the funds in dispute shall be released to the
Department for final determination.  The Rent Adjustment Commission shall
establish guidelines for the establishment of these escrow accounts, the
certification of vacation and pre-vacation disbursement requests.



 



   3.   Any tenant subject to displacement due to an unapproved
dwelling unit as a result of a notice to vacate or other order requiring the
vacation of the dwelling unit in violation of the municipal code or any other
provision of law, where the landlord has had a reasonable opportunity to
correct the violation, shall be entitled to relocation payable by the
landlord to the tenant of the affected rental unit within 15 days of service
of the tenant's written notice of termination of the tenancy in accordance
with Section 151.09 G. of this Code.  (Amended by Ord. No. 184,822, Eff.

(as required by state law) of a proposed rent increase on the tenant 15 days
after the landlord has applied to the Rent Stabilization Division for such an
increase.  The landlord shall not accept or demand a rent increase from the

services contract.  Any monies paid pursuant to an additional services

of the tenancy. (Added by Ord. No. 156,597, Eff. 5/20/82, Oper. 5/15/82.)

Department.  The Form must contain, at a minimum, the following:



 



   1.   A description of the rental unit, including the address with
zip code, the number of bathrooms and bedrooms;



 



   2.   Identification of amenities to be provided by the landlord
during the Fixed Relief Period, and amenities that will be provided by the
landlord after the Fixed Relief Period.  The identification of amenities
shall include whether the landlord will furnish the rental unit and which
utilities, if any, will be paid by the landlord;



 



   3.   The Fair Market Value Rent applicable to the rental unit;



 



   4.   The Reduced Rental Rate that will be charged during the Fixed
Relief Period, and the Increased Rental Rate that the landlord may charge at
the end of the Fixed Relief Period;



 



   5.   The registration number issued by FEMA to the Displacee; and



 



   6.   A statement that the Displacee may terminate the lease upon
thirty days notice and will not be liable for rent that would otherwise be
owed for the remainder of the term of the Fixed Relief Period and the
remainder of the lease, nor for damages resulting from termination prior to
expiration of the Fixed Relief Period and the lease.



 



The completed Qualifying Relief Rental Agreement Form must be signed by the
Displacee and the landlord.  The Department will not accept for filing any
Form that does not contain the information required by this subsection, that
does not demonstrate that the initial rent charged under the Program is not
greater than 75% of the applicable Fair Market Value Rent, and that is not
signed by the Displacee and the landlord.



 



   E.   Effect of Failure to Increase Rent at the Expiration of Fixed
Relief Period.  A landlord may continue to rent to a Displacee at the
Reduced Rental Rate upon the expiration of a Fixed Relief Period.  A
landlord who does not increase the rental rate upon the expiration of the
Fixed Relief Period may impose one rent increase on or before December 31,
2006, provided that the new rental amount does not exceed the Increased
Rental Rate.  If, on January 1, 2007, the landlord has not increased the
rent from the Reduced Rental Rate, the rent cannot further be increased
without compliance with the provisions of the Rent Stabilization Ordinance,
including those provided pursuant to Section 151.06.



 



   F.   Ineligible Rental Units.  Rental Units may not be rented
pursuant to the provisions of this section if they are located in
buildings:  (1) that have been placed into the Rent Escrow Account Program
pursuant to Section 162.00 et seq., or Section 155.00 et seq., and the REAP
placement is not yet terminated; (2) for which there is an outstanding order
or notice to comply, correct or abate a condition or violation issued by an
Enforcement Agency as defined in Section 162.02; or (3) that contain a rental
unit that the Department has determined is being rented in violation of the
Rent Stabilization Ordinance, and the Department has notified the landlord in
writing of that determination.



 



   G.   Termination of Program.  Effective January 1, 2007, rent can
be increased only in compliance with the provisions of the Rent Stabilization
Ordinance, including the provisions of Section 151.06.



 



   H.   Authority of Department to Administer Program.  The Department
is authorized to administer the Program, and may develop procedures and
regulations to assist in the administration.  The Department may require the
landlord to provide notice to Displacees on forms provided by the Department,
and may require the landlord to file documents other than the Qualifying
Relief Rental Agreement Form, including documents issued by FEMA identifying
the Displacee's FEMA registration number.  Nothing in this Subsection H. is
intended to limit the authority of the Department to administer the Program.



 



 



SEC. 151.22.  ELLIS ACT PROVISIONS - STATEMENT OF PURPOSE AND EFFECT.



   (Added by Ord. No. 177,901, Eff. 9/29/06.)



 



   California Government Code Sections 7060, et seq. (the "Ellis Act")
permits the City, among other things, to require landlords to provide all
tenants with 120 days notice, or one year if the tenants lived in the
accommodations for at least one year and are more than 62 years of age or
disabled, when rental units subject to the Rent Stabilization Ordinance are
to be withdrawn from the rental market.  The Ellis Act also permits the City
to impose other restrictions, conditions and requirements upon the
property.  It is the purpose of this section, and Sections 151.23 through
151.28, to implement provisions of the Ellis Act.  The Department may
develop forms and regulations to assist in the implementation of these
provisions.



 



   There continues to be a low vacancy rate for rental units in the City
of Los Angeles, and the withdrawal of residential rental property from rent
or lease will exacerbate the rental housing shortage and make it more
difficult for tenants displaced by the withdrawal to obtain replacement
housing.  Because of the rental housing shortage, it is essential that
tenants be afforded substantial advance notice to enable them to obtain
replacement housing, and that they receive other protections available under
law.



 



   In any action by a landlord to recover possession of a rental unit
subject to the Rent Stabilization Ordinance, including, but not limited to,
where an owner seeks to displace a tenant from accommodations withdrawn from
rent pursuant to this chapter by an unlawful detainer proceeding, the tenant
may appear and answer or demurer pursuant to California Code of Civil
Procedure Section 1170 and may raise as an affirmative defense the failure of
the landlord to comply with one or more of the requirements of Sections
151.22 through 151.28, as well as the failure of the landlord to comply with
any other requirement of this chapter. (Amended by Ord. No. 185,224, Eff.
12/13/17.)



 



   If rental units subject to the Rent Stabilization Ordinance were
demolished subsequent to September 29, 2006, the effective date of Sections
151.22 through 151.28, without complying with the requirements set forth
hereunder, then all replacement rental units constructed on the same property
shall be deemed subject to the Rent Stabilization Ordinance, Section 151.00,
et seq., and other provisions of this chapter.  Additionally, any landlord
who is found to have demolished a property subject to the Rent Stabilization
Ordinance subsequent to September 29, 2006, without complying with the
requirements of Sections 151.22 through 151.28 shall be subject to a
penalty.  (Added by Ord. No. 184,873, Eff. 6/4/17.)



 



   Pursuant to California Government Code section 7060, the Ellis Act and
Sections 151.22 through 151.28 shall not apply to a Residential Hotel as
defined in accordance with California Health and Safety Code section 50519
and Section 47.70, et seq., of this Code.  (Added by Ord. No. 184,873, Eff.

   (Added by Ord. No. 177,901, Eff. 9/29/06.)



 



   Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter to the contrary, if a
landlord desires to demolish rental units subject to the Rent Stabilization
Ordinance, or otherwise withdraw the units from rental housing use,
irrespective of whether such rental units are occupied or vacant, then the
following provisions shall apply:  (Amended by Ord. No. 184,873, Eff.
6/4/17.)



 



   A.   Notice of Intent to Withdraw.  (Amended by Ord. No. 184,873,
Eff. 6/4/17.)  The landlord shall notify the Department of an intention to
withdraw a rental unit from rental housing use.  This Notice of Intent to
Withdraw shall be filed with the Department whether the rental unit(s) to be
withdrawn or demolished are occupied or vacant at the time of filing and
shall contain the following:



 



   1.   statements, under penalty of perjury on the form and in the
number prescribed by the Department, stating that the landlord intends to
demolish the rental unit or to remove the rental unit from rental housing use;



 



   2.   the address or location of the rental unit;



 



   3.   the number of rental units to be demolished or removed from
rental housing use;



 



   4.   the names of the tenants, if any, of each rental unit and that
the landlord intends to evict such tenants in order to demolish the rental
unit or to remove the rental unit from rental housing use;



 



   5.   the date on which the rental unit will be withdrawn from rental
housing use; and



 



   6.   the rent applicable to that rental unit.



 



   The Department shall have the authority to promulgate forms and
procedures to assist in the implementation of this subdivision.



 



   B.   Recordation of Non-Confidential Memorandum and Extension of the
Date of Withdrawal from Rental Housing Use.  Irrespective of whether the
rental units to be withdrawn or demolished are occupied or vacant at the time
of filing the Notice of Intent to Withdraw, the landlord shall record with
the County Recorder a memorandum summarizing the provisions of the Notice of
Intent to Withdraw, other than provisions that are confidential pursuant to
this section.  If applicable, information respecting the name or names of
the tenants, the rent applicable to any rental unit, and the total number of
units is confidential information and shall be treated as confidential
information by the Department for purposes of the Information Practices Act
of 1977, as contained in Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 1798) of Title
1.8 of Part 4 of Division 3 of the Civil Code.  (Amended by Ord. No.
184,873, Eff. 6/4/17.)



 



   The landlord shall submit a copy of the memorandum filed with the
County Recorder to the Department concurrently with the Notice of Intent to
Withdraw, with a certification that actions have been initiated as required
by law to terminate any existing tenancies.



 



   The date on which the rental units are to be withdrawn from rental
housing use shall be at least 120 days from the date of the delivery to the
Department in person or by first-class mail of the Notice of Intent to
Withdraw.



 



   If the tenant is at least 62 years of age or disabled (as defined in
Government Code Section 12955.3) and has lived in his or her accommodations
for at least one year prior to the date of delivery to the Department of the
Notice of Intent to Withdraw pursuant to Subsection A. of this section, then
the date of withdrawal of the accommodations of that tenant shall be extended
to one year after the date of delivery of that Notice to the Department. 
This extension shall take place, if and only if, the tenant gives written
notice of his or her entitlement to an extension to the landlord within 60
days of the date of delivery to the Department of the Notice of Intent to
Withdraw.  In that situation, the following provisions shall apply:



 



   1.   The tenancy shall be continued on the same terms and conditions
as existed on the date of delivery to the Department of the Notice of Intent
to Withdraw, subject to any adjustments otherwise available under the Rent
Stabilization Ordinance.



 



   2.   No party shall be relieved of the duty to perform any
obligation under the lease or rental agreement.



 



   3.   The landlord may elect to extend the date of withdrawal on any
other rental units up to one year after the date of delivery to the
Department of the Notice of Intent to Withdraw, subject to Subparagraphs 1.
and 2.



 



   4.   Within 30 days of the notification by the tenant to the
landlord of his or her entitlement to an extension, the landlord shall give
written notice to the Department of the claim that the tenant is entitled to
stay in the accommodations for one year after the date of delivery to the
Department of the Notice of Intent to Withdraw.



 



   5.   Within 90 days of the date of delivery to the Department of the
Notice of Intent to Withdraw, the landlord shall give written notice to the
Department and the affected tenant of the landlord's election to extend the
date of withdrawal and the new date of withdrawal under Subparagraph 3.



 



   C.   Notice to the Tenants of Pending Withdrawal.  Within five days
of delivery to the Department of the Notice of Intent to Withdraw with the
certification required under Subsection B. of this section, and a copy of the
memorandum recorded by the County Recorder, the landlord shall notify, by
delivery in person or by first-class mail, each affected tenant of the
following:



 



   1.   That the Department has been notified pursuant to Subsection
A., including the date of the delivery to the Department of the Notice of
Intent to Withdraw;



 



   2.   That the Notice delivered to the Department specified the name
and the amount of rent paid by the tenant as an occupant of the
accommodations;



 



   3.   The amount of rent the landlord specified in the notice to the
Department;

   5.   Notice to the tenant stating the following:



 



   (a)   If the tenant is at least 62 years of age or disabled, and has
lived in his or her accommodations for at least one year prior to the date of
delivery to the Department of the Notice of Intent to Withdraw, then the
tenancy shall be extended to one year after the date of delivery to the
Department of the Notice of Intent to Withdraw, provided that the tenant
gives written notice of his or her entitlement to the landlord within 60 days
of the date of delivery to the Department of the Notice of Intent to Withdraw;



 



   (b)   The extended tenancy shall be continued on the same terms and
conditions as existed on the date of delivery to the Department of the Notice
of Intent to Withdraw, subject to any adjustments otherwise available under
the Rent Stabilization Ordinance; and



 



   (c)   No party shall be relieved of the duty to perform any
obligation under the lease or rental agreement during the extended tenancy.



 



   D.   Annual Property Status Reports.  (Added by Ord. No. 184,873,
Eff. 6/4/17.)  For no less than seven (7) years following the date of

Notice of Intention to Re-Rent Withdrawn Accommodations with the Department.



 



   C.   If a landlord offers for rent or lease a rental unit which was
the subject of a Notice of Intent to Withdraw pursuant to the provisions of
Subsection A. of Section 151.23, irrespective of whether a Notice of
Intention to Re-Rent Withdrawn Accommodations has been filed with the

   A.   A landlord who offers accommodations for rent or lease within
two years from the date of withdrawal shall first offer to rent or lease each
unit to the tenant or tenants displaced from that unit by the withdrawal,
provided that the tenant or tenants advised the landlord in writing within 30
days of displacement of his or her desire to consider an offer to renew the
tenancy, and provided the landlord with an address to which that offer is to
be directed.  That tenant or tenants may advise the landlord at any time
during the period of eligibility of a change of address to which an offer is
to be directed.



 



   If a landlord again offers accommodations for rent or lease pursuant to

demolished, for three consecutive years prior to filing an application for
exemption.  To obtain this exemption, an owner must apply to the Department
for exemption pursuant to the provisions of Subdivision 3. of Subsection C.
of this section.



 



   Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained herein, if
rental units subject to the Rent Stabilization Ordinance were demolished
subsequent to September 29, 2006, the effective date of these provisions,
without complying with the requirements of Sections 151.22 through 151.28,
then all replacement rental units constructed on the same property shall be
deemed subject to the Rent Stabilization Ordinance, Section 151.00, et seq.,
and other provisions of this chapter.  Additionally, any landlord who is
found to have demolished a property subject to the Rent Stabilization
Ordinance subsequent to September 29, 2006 without complying with the
requirements of Sections 151.22 through 151.28 shall be subject to a penalty
to be adopted by Council.  (Added by Ord. No. 184,873, Eff. 6/4/17.)



 



   B.   Exemption from the Rent Stabilization Ordinance with
Replacement Affordable Units.  (Amended by Ord. No. 184,873, Eff. 6/4/17.) 
An owner who replaces the number of demolished rental units with a number of
affordable housing units at least equal to the number of withdrawn rental
units subject to the Rent Stabilization Ordinance on a one-for-one basis or
at least 20% of the total number of newly constructed rental units, whichever
is greater, may apply to the Department for an exemption of the newly
constructed rental units from the provisions of the Rent Stabilization
Ordinance.  The affordable housing units must be located in the newly
constructed accommodations.  The Department shall issue an exemption where
it finds all of the following to exist:



 



   1.   The owner executed and recorded a covenant and agreement, in a
form satisfactory to the Department, guaranteeing that the replacement
affordable housing units, affordable for low or very low households with an
income at or below 80% of Area Median Income as established by the California
Department of Housing and Community Development or any successor agency,
shall remain affordable for 55 years from the date the covenant and agreement
is recorded.  The covenant and agreement must contain provisions as required
by the Department to ensure the effective administration and enforcement of
this subsection.



 



   2.   The replacement affordable housing units shall be reasonably
dispersed throughout the newly constructed accommodations and shall not be
segregated in a portion of the accommodations dedicated to affordable housing
units.



 



   3.   The replacement affordable housing units shall be comparable to
the market rate units and contain, on average, the same number of bedrooms,
bathrooms and square footage as the market rate units.  The replacement
affordable housing units shall be comparable in architectural style to the
average of the market rate units.



 



   Units that are used to qualify for a density bonus pursuant to the
provisions of either California Government Code Section 65915 or Los Angeles
Municipal Code Section 12.22 A.25., or are used to satisfy any inclusionary
zoning or replacement affordable housing requirement, or are used to qualify
for any other public benefit or incentive, may be used to qualify as
replacement affordable housing units pursuant to the provisions of this
subsection.



 



   C.   Application for Exemption from the Rent Stabilization Ordinance.



 



   1.   Hardship Exemption.  (Amended by Ord. No. 186,455, Eff.
1/15/20.)  The Department shall have the authority to grant an exemption
from the provisions of this section in cases of undue financial hardship
arising from detrimental reliance upon the provisions of this article before
enactment of this section.  An owner claiming a hardship exemption for their
multi-family project (project) must file a written application on the form(s)
provided by the Department which demonstrates to the satisfaction of the
Department that the criteria of either Paragraph (a) or (b) have been met:



 



   (a)   The application was filed with the Department within 90 days
of June 4, 2017 (the date Ordinance No. 184,873 was enacted), and
demonstrates that the hardship to the project existed as of that date; or



 



   (b)   The application is filed with the Department within 60 days of
the effective date of this Paragraph (b) and demonstrates that the owner
received discretionary entitlements for the project before June 4, 2017, and
that at least fifteen percent (15%) of the total number of units at the
project are restricted for and affordable to Very Low Income households for a
term of 55 years from the date of issuance of the certificate of occupancy
and the number of Very Low Income restricted units is no less than the number
of rental units subject to the Rent Stabilization Ordinance demolished for
the project, if any.



 



   An owner who files an application for exemption pursuant to the
provisions of this subdivision shall pay to the Department an administrative
fee in the amount of $160.00 for each application.  The administrative fee
shall be used to finance the costs of processing and investigating
applications for exemption.



 



   2.   Replacement Affordable Housing Unit Exemption.  An owner may,
at any time, apply for exemption pursuant to the provisions of Subsection B.
of this section, but must do so by written application on a form provided by
the Department.  If the Department issues an exemption while there are
tenants residing in rental units that are subject to the provisions of the
Rent Stabilization Ordinance, each of the units shall continue to be subject
to the provisions of the Rent Stabilization Ordinance until all tenants in a
unit voluntarily vacate the unit, or have their tenancies terminated pursuant
to the provisions of Subdivisions 1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6., 7., 9., 11., or 12.
of Subsection A. of Section 151.09 of this article.



 



   An owner who files an application for exemption from the Rent
Stabilization Ordinance pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision shall
pay to the Department an administrative fee in the amount of $705.00 for each
application, plus $75.00 for each replacement affordable housing unit.  The
administrative fee shall be used to finance the costs of processing and
investigating applications for exemption, and continued monitoring.



 



   3.   Owner Occupancy Exemption.  An owner, whose name appears on
legal title to the property, may file an application for exemption from the
Rent Stabilization Ordinance on the grounds that the owner is a natural
person who occupied the demolished building, which consisted of four or fewer
rental units, for three years prior to the demolition of the building.  If
the building has not yet been demolished, an owner may file an application
for exemption from Subsection A. of Section 151.28 on the grounds that the
building to be demolished consists of four or fewer rental units, and that
the owner occupied the building for three consecutive years prior to filing
an application for exemption.  An owner may, at any time, apply for
exemption, but must do so by written application on a form provided by the
Department.  If the Department issues an exemption while there are tenants
residing in units that are subject to the provisions of the Rent
Stabilization Ordinance, each of the units shall continue to be subject to
the provisions of the Rent Stabilization Ordinance until all tenants in a
unit voluntarily vacate the unit, or have their tenancies terminated pursuant
to the provisions of Subdivisions 1., 2., 3., 4., 5., 6., 7., 9., 11., or 12.
of Subsection A. of Section 151.09 of this article.



 



   An owner who files an application for exemption from the Rent
Stabilization Ordinance pursuant to the provisions of this subdivision shall
pay to the Department an administrative fee in an amount to be determined by
ordinance.  The administrative fee shall be used to finance the costs of
processing and investigating applications for exemption.



 



   4.   Verification of Information.  Information submitted in any
written application to the Department for any of the exemptions outlined in
this section, will be subject to verification and approval by the Department.



 



   D.   Appeals.  An owner who is denied an exemption from the Rent
Stabilization Ordinance for an application filed pursuant to the provisions
of Subsection C. of this section may appeal the denial by requesting a
hearing before the General Manager.  The appeal must be filed in writing and
received by the Department within 15 calendar days of the date of mailing the
denial decision.  The appeal must be on a form provided by the Department
and identify the grounds for appeal.  If an appeal from a decision to deny
an exemption is not received by the Department within the 15 day appeal
period, the decision will be final.



 



   An owner who files an appeal from an application for exemption filed
pursuant to the provisions of Subdivisions 1. or 2. of Subsection C. of this
section shall pay to the Department an administrative fee in the amount of
$290.00 for each appeal.  An owner who files an appeal from an application
for exemption filed pursuant to the provisions of Subdivision 3. of
Subsection C. of this section shall pay to the Department an administrative
fee in an amount to be determined by ordinance.  The fee shall be used to
finance the cost of the appeal process.



 



   The General Manager's hearing shall be held within 30 days of receiving
the appeal and will follow the procedures set forth in Division 8 of Article
1 of Chapter XVI of this Code.  The owner may present proof at the hearing
of entitlement to an exemption, and a Department representative shall explain
the reason for the denial of the exemption application.



 



   The General Manager shall issue a written decision of the appeal and
may affirm, modify, or reverse the determination of the Department.  The
General Manager may grant a continuance of the hearing upon a showing of good
cause or where further Department investigation is warranted.



 



   E.   Authority of Department.  The Department shall be responsible
for carrying out the provisions of this section and shall have the authority
to promulgate and administer policies, rules, and regulations to effectuate
the purposes of this section.

   State law, including the Mobilehome Residency Law at California Civil
Code Section 798, et seq., governs many aspects of agreements to rent
mobilehomes.  This section supplements the provisions of the State
Mobilehome Residency Law.

in a mobilehome park subject to the provisions of this article shall have the
option to reject a rental agreement offered for the lease of a mobilehome,
and to reject a rental agreement offered for the lease of the site of the
mobilehome, and shall be entitled to accept a rental agreement for a term of
12 months or less, including a month-to-month agreement, pursuant to the
provisions of state law and Subsection C. of this section.



 



   B.   Neither a mobilehome owner nor a prospective mobilehome owner

agreement in excess of 12 months duration shall be entitled to instead accept
a rental agreement for a term of 12 months or less from the date the offered
rental agreement was to have begun.  In the event the prospective mobilehome
owner elects to have a rental agreement for a term of 12 months or less,
including a month-to-month rental agreement, the rental agreement shall
contain the same rental charges, terms and conditions as the rejected rental
agreement during the first 12 months, except for options, if any, contained
in the offered rental agreement to extend or renew the rental agreement.



 



   D.   Before any rental agreement in excess of 12 months is executed
by a prospective mobilehome owner, the prospective mobilehome owner shall: 
(i) be offered the option of a rental agreement for a term of 12 months or
less; and (ii) be informed both orally and in writing that a lease or rental
agreement in excess of 12 months shall not be subject to the terms and
provisions of this article.



 



   E.   A notice, which conforms to the following language and printed

INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO A TENANCY OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS THAT IS NOT EXEMPT FROM

SEC. 151.30.  EVICTIONS FOR OWNER, FAMILY, OR RESIDENT MANAGER OCCUPANCY.



   (Added by Ord. No. 180,747, Eff. 8/1/09.)



 



   Notwithstanding any provision of this Chapter to the contrary, if a
landlord seeks to recover possession of a rental unit pursuant to the
provisions of Subdivision 8. of Subsection A. of Section 151.09 of this Code,
the following provisions shall apply:



 



   A.   Ownership Requirement.  A landlord may recover possession of a
rental unit  pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph a of Subdivision 8. of
Subsection A. of Section 151.09 only if the landlord is a natural person who
possesses legal title to at least 25 percent of the property containing the
rental unit, or is a beneficiary with an interest of at least 25 percent in a
trust that owns the property.  A landlord may recover possession of a rental
unit pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph b. of Subdivision 8. of
Subsection A. of Section 151.09 only if the landlord is a natural person who
possesses legal title to at least 50 percent of the property containing the
rental unit, or is a beneficiary with an interest of at least 50 percent in a
trust that owns the property.  A landlord may recover possession of a rental
unit pursuant to the provisions of Subdivision 8. of Subsection A. of Section
151.09 for use and occupancy by the landlord, landlord's spouse, grandchild,
child, parent, or grandparent only once for that person in each rental
complex of the landlord.



 



   B.   Residency Requirements for Replacement Occupant.  The landlord
must in good faith intend that the owner, eligible relative, or a resident
manager will occupy the rental unit within three months after the existing
tenant vacates the rental unit, and that the owner, eligible relative, or a
resident manager will occupy the rental unit as a primary residence for a
period of two consecutive years.  Failure of the owner, eligible relative,
or a resident manager to occupy the rental unit within three months after the
existing tenant vacates the unit, or failure of the owner, eligible relative,
or a resident manager to occupy the rental unit as a primary residence for a
period of two consecutive years, may be evidence that the landlord acted in
bad faith in recovering possession of a rental unit pursuant to the
provisions of Subdivision 8. of Subsection A. of Section 151.09.  It will
not be evidence of bad faith if a landlord recovers possession of a rental
unit for use and occupancy by a resident manager, and during the next two
years replaces the resident manager with a different resident manager.



 



   C.   Comparable Rental Unit.  A landlord may not recover possession
of a rental unit pursuant to the provisions of Subdivision 8. of Subsection
A. of Section 151.09 if there is a comparable rental unit in the building
that is vacant, except that where a building has an existing resident
manager, the landlord may evict the existing resident manager in order to
replace the existing resident manager with a new manager.  (Amended by Ord.
No. 184,822, Eff. 4/30/17.)



 



   D.   Tenants Eligible for Termination of Tenancy.



 



   1.   Protected tenants.  A landlord may not recover possession of a
rental unit pursuant to the provisions of Subdivision 8. of Subsection A. of
Section 151.09 if:



 



   (a)   any tenant in the rental unit has continuously resided in the
rental unit for at least ten years, and is either:  (i) 62 years of age or
older; or (ii) disabled as defined in Title 42 United States Code Section 423
or handicapped as defined in Section 50072 of the California Health and
Safety Code; or



 



   (b)   any tenant in the rental unit is terminally ill as certified
by a treating physician licensed to practice in the State of California.



 



   2.   Application to most recent tenant.  A landlord may recover
possession of a rental unit pursuant  to the provisions of Subdivision 8. of
Subsection A. of Section 151.09 only from a tenant who is the most recent
tenant, not protected from termination of tenancy pursuant to the provisions
of Subdivision (1) of this Subsection, to occupy a rental unit in the
building with the same number of bedrooms needed by the landlord, the
landlord's eligible relative or the resident manager, except that a landlord
may recover possession from a different tenant if a different unit is
required because of medical necessity, as certified by a treating physician
licensed to practice in the State of California.



 



   E.   Relocation Fees.  A landlord who terminates a tenancy pursuant
to the provisions of Subdivision 8. of Subsection A. of Section 151.09 shall
pay a relocation fee pursuant to the provisions of Subsection G. of Section
151.09, except in the following circumstance:



 



   If the termination of tenancy is based on the grounds set forth in
Paragraphs (a) or (b) of Subdivision 8. of Subsection A. of Section 151.09,
and all of the following conditions exist:  (1) the building containing the
rental unit contains four or fewer rental units; (2) within the previous
three years the landlord has not paid the fee authorized by this Subsection
to any tenant who resided in the building; (3) the landlord owns, in the City
of Los Angeles, no more than four units of residential property and a
single-family home on a separate lot; and (4) any eligible relative for whom
the landlord is recovering possession of the rental unit does not own any
residential property in the City of Los Angeles; then the landlord shall pay
a relocation fee of $14,000 to qualified tenants and a fee of $7,000 to all
other tenants.  If more than one fee applies to a rental unit, the landlord
shall pay the highest of the applicable fees.  For the year beginning July
1, 2009, and all subsequent years, the fee amounts shall be adjusted on an
annual basis pursuant to the formula set forth in Section 151.06 D. of this
Code.  The adjusted amount shall be rounded to the nearest $50 increment. 
The fee payment shall be made in accordance with the provisions of
Subdivisions 1., 2., and 3. of Subsection G. of Section 151.09, and the
provisions of Subdivision 4. of Subsection G. of Section 151.09 apply to
determine whether a relocation fee is owed.



 



   F.   Post-Tenancy Termination Filing Requirements.



 



   (1)   Three month filing requirement.  Within three months of a
tenant's vacation of a rental unit, a landlord who recovered possession of a
rental unit pursuant to the provisions of Subdivision 8. of Subsection A. of
Section 151.09 shall file with the Department a statement under penalty of
perjury that the rental unit is occupied by the landlord, eligible relative,
or resident manager for whom the landlord terminated the tenancy, or an
explanation why the rental unit is not occupied by the landlord, eligible
relative, or resident manager for whom the landlord terminated the tenancy.



 



   (2)   Annual filing requirements.  A landlord who recovers
possession of a rental unit pursuant to the provisions of Subdivision 8. of
Subsection A. of Section 151.09 must, within thirty days preceding the first
and second year anniversary of the tenant's vacation of the rental unit, file
with the Department a statement under penalty of perjury regarding the
continued occupancy of the rental unit by the landlord, eligible relative, or
a resident manager.  The statement must confirm the continued occupancy by
the landlord, eligible relative, or a resident manager, or if the occupancy
did not continue, the statement must explain why the rental unit is not
occupied by such person.



 



   G.   Tenant Re-Rental Rights.  A landlord who offers a rental unit
that was the subject of a tenancy termination pursuant to the provisions of
Subdivision 8. of Subsection A. of Section 151.09 for rent or lease within
two years after the tenant vacated the rental unit shall first offer to rent
the rental unit to the displaced tenant or tenants, provided that the tenant
or tenants advised the landlord in writing within 30 days of displacement of
the tenant's desire to consider an offer to renew the tenancy and provided
the landlord and Department with an address to which to direct the offer. 
The tenant or tenants may advise the landlord and Department any time during
the two year period of eligibility of a change of address to which to direct
the offer.



 



   A landlord who offers to rent or lease a rental unit to a previously
displaced tenant pursuant to the provisions of this Subsection shall deposit
the offer in the United States mail, by registered or certified mail with
postage prepaid, addressed to the displaced tenant or tenants at the address
furnished to the landlord as provided in this Subsection, and shall describe
the terms of the offer.  The displaced tenant or tenants shall have 30 days
from the deposit of the offer in the mail to accept the offer by personal
delivery of that acceptance or by deposit of the acceptance in the United
States mail by registered or certified mail with postage prepaid.



 



   H.   Notice of Re-Rental.  If a landlord desires to offer for rent
or lease a rental unit that was the subject of a tenancy termination pursuant
to the provisions of Subdivision 8. of Subsection A. of Section 151.09, the
landlord must file with the Department a Notice of Intention to Re-Rent
Rental Unit on a form prescribed by the Department.  The form must be filed
before renting or leasing the rental unit.



 



   I.   Penalties.  In addition to all other penalties authorized by
law, the following penalties apply for violations of the provisions of
Subdivision 8. of Subsection A. of Section 151.09, and of this Section:



 



   (1)   If a landlord acts in bad faith in recovering possession of a
rental unit pursuant to the provisions of Subdivision 8. of Subsection A. of
Section 151.09, the landlord shall be liable to any tenant who was displaced
from the property for three times the amount of actual damages, exemplary
damages, equitable relief, and attorneys' fees.  The City may institute a
civil proceeding for equitable relief and exemplary damages for displacement
of tenants.  Nothing in this paragraph precludes a tenant or the City from
pursuing any other remedy available under the law.



 



   (2)   A landlord who fails to file a statement under penalty of
perjury as required by the provisions of Subsection F. of this Section, or a
notice as required by the provisions of Subsection H. of this Section, shall
pay a fine in the amount of $250 per day for each day that the statement or
notice is delinquent.

   (Added by Ord. No. 176,544, Eff. 5/2/05.)



 



   This article shall be known as the Tenant Habitability Program.



 



 



SEC. 152.01.  DECLARATION OF PURPOSE.



   (Added by Ord. No. 176,544, Eff. 5/2/05.)



 



   In its adoption of Section 151.00et seq. of this Code, the City
recognized that displacement from rental housing creates hardships on renters
who are senior citizens, persons on fixed incomes and low and moderate income
households, particularly when there is a shortage of decent, safe and
sanitary housing at affordable rent levels in the City.  The City has also
declared, in its adoption of Section 161.101et seq. of this Code, that it is
in the public interest of the people of Los Angeles to protect and promote
the existence of sound and wholesome residential buildings, dwelling units
and neighborhoods by the adoption and enforcement of such standards,
regulations and procedures as will remedy the existence or prevent the
development or creation of dangerous, substandard, or unsanitary and
deficient residential buildings and dwelling units.



 



   The primary renovation program has been established to encourage
landlords to extend the useful life of the rental housing stock in Los
Angeles by reinvesting in the infrastructure of their properties.  Through
rent adjustments authorized by this chapter, landlords are able to recover a
substantial portion of these renovation costs.  However, Primary Renovation
Work involves the replacement or substantial modification of major building
systems or the abatement of hazardous materials and, by its very nature, such
work generally makes rental units untenantable, as defined by California
Civil Code Section 1941.1, on a temporary basis.



 



   This article is adopted to facilitate landlord investment in Primary
Renovation Work without subjecting tenants to either untenantable housing
conditions during such renovation work or forced permanent displacement. 
The tenant habitability program requires landlords to mitigate such temporary
untenantable conditions, either through actions to ensure that tenants can
safely remain in place during construction or through the temporary
relocation of tenants to alternative housing accommodations.  These two
options should not be regarded as mutually exclusive but rather as
complementary approaches that might be appropriate to different stages of the
renovation process.



 



 



SEC. 152.02.  DEFINITIONS.



   (Added by Ord. No. 176,544, Eff. 5/2/05.)



 



   The following words and phrases, whenever used in this article, shall
be construed as defined in this section.  Words and phrases not defined here
shall be construed as defined in Sections 12.03, 151.02 and 162.02 of this
Code, if defined in those sections.



 



   Notice of Primary Renovation Work.  Written notice, served by the
landlord upon a tenant or tenant household at least 60 days, or as otherwise
modified pursuant to Section 152.04, prior to the commencement of any Primary
Renovation Work or Related Work and using a form established by the
Department, advising the tenant of forthcoming Primary Renovation Work and
Related Work, the impact of such work on the tenant, and measures the
landlord will take to mitigate the impact on the tenant.  (Amended by Ord.
No. 183,893, Eff. 11/22/15.)



 



   Temporary Relocation.  The moving of a tenant from the tenant's
permanent residence to habitable temporary housing accommodations in
accordance with a Tenant Habitability Plan.  The temporary relocation of a
tenant from his/her permanent place of residence shall not constitute the
voluntary vacation of the unit and shall not terminate the status and rights
of a tenant, including the right to reoccupy the same unit, upon the
completion of the Primary Renovation Work and any Related Work, subject to
any rent adjustments as may be authorized under this chapter.



 



 



SEC. 152.03.  PROCEDURE FOR UNDERTAKING PRIMARY RENOVATION WORK.



   (Added by Ord. No. 176,544, Eff. 5/2/05.)



 



   A.   Building Permits.



 



   1.   No landlord shall undertake Primary Renovation Work without
first obtaining a permit, pursuant to Sections 91.106, 92.0129, 92.0132,
93.0201, 94.103, or 95.112.2 of this Code.  This requirement applies to all
Primary Renovation Work, regardless of whether such work is eligible for a
rent adjustment under any of the provisions of Section 151.07 A.1. of this
Code and regardless of which provision of that subdivision, if any, is
intended to be used as a ground for seeking a rent adjustment following the
completion of the work.



 



   2.   The Department shall clear a landlord's application for a
permit for Primary Renovation Work if both of the following conditions have
been met:



 



   a.   The landlord has submitted a Tenant Habitability Plan which, in
accordance with Subsection C. of this section, the Department finds to
adequately mitigate the impact of Primary Renovation Work and any Related
Work upon affected tenants; and



 



   b.   The landlord has submitted a declaration documenting service to
affected tenants of both a Notice of Primary Renovation Work and a copy of
the non-confidential portions of the Tenant Habitability Plan.



 



   B.   Tenant Habitability Plan.  At a minimum, a Tenant Habitability
Plan shall provide the following information, together with any other
information the Department deems necessary to ensure that the impact of
Primary Renovation Work and any Related Work upon affected tenants is
adequately mitigated:



 



   1.   Identification of the landlord, the general contractor
responsible for the Primary Renovation Work, and any specialized contractor
responsible for hazardous material abatement, including but not limited to
lead-based paint and asbestos.



 



   2.   Identification of all affected tenants including the current
rent each tenant pays and the date of each tenant's last rent increase.  In
accordance with California Civil Code Sec. 1798 et seq., information
regarding tenants shall be considered confidential.



 



   3.   Description of the scope of work covering the Primary
Renovation Work and any Related Work.  Such description shall address the
overall work to be undertaken on all affected units and common areas, the
specific work to be undertaken on each affected unit, an estimate of the
total project cost and time, and an estimate of the cost and time of
renovation for each affected unit.



 



   4.   Identification of the impact of the Primary Renovation Work and
Related Work on the habitability of affected rental units, including a
discussion of impact severity and duration with regard to noise, utility
interruption, exposure to hazardous materials, interruption of fire safety
systems, inaccessibility of all or portions of each affected rental unit, and
disruption of other tenant services.



 



   5.   Identification of the mitigation measures that will be adopted
to ensure that tenants are not required to occupy an untenantable dwelling,
as defined in California Civil Code Section 1941.1, outside of the hours of
8:00 am through 5:00 pm, Monday through Friday, and are not exposed at any
time to toxic or hazardous materials including, but not limited to,
lead-based paint and asbestos.  Such measures may include the adoption of
work procedures that allow a tenant to remain on-site and/or the temporary
relocation of tenants.



 



   6.   Identification of the impact of the Primary Renovation Work and
Related Work on the personal property of affected tenants, including work
areas which must be cleared of furnishings and other tenant property, and the
exposure of tenant property to theft or damage from hazards related to work
or storage.



 



   7.   Identification of the mitigation measures that will be adopted
to secure and protect tenant property from reasonably foreseeable damage or
loss.



 



   C.   Plan Acceptance.



 



   1.   The Department shall make a determination regarding the
adequacy of a landlord's Tenant Habitability Plan within five working days of
the Department's receipt of the plan for review.  The Department shall
accept those plans which meet the requirements of Subsection B. of this
section and which it determines, with reference to the standards set forth in
California Civil Code Section 1941.1 and in accordance with any regulations
or guidelines adopted by the Commission, will adequately mitigate the impacts
of Primary Renovation Work and any Related Work upon tenants.  The Tenant
Habitability Plan may allow for the temporary disruption of major systems
during the hours of 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., Monday through Friday, without
requiring the relocation of tenants in order to adequately mitigate the
impacts upon the affected tenants.  However tenants should not be exposed at
any time to toxic or hazardous materials including, but not limited to,
lead-based paint and asbestos.



 



   2.   The Department's acceptance of a Tenant Habitability Plan shall
be subject to the landlord having no outstanding balances due for rent
registration or code enforcement fees.



 



   3.   The Department shall provide landlords with written indications
of deficiencies which must be addressed whenever a Tenant Habitability Plan
is determined to be inadequate. A landlord may submit an amended plan in
order to correct identified deficiencies.



 



   4.   Landlords and tenants may appeal the Department's determination
regarding a Tenant Habitability Plan to a hearing officer.  The appeal shall
be made in writing, upon appropriate forms provided by the Department, and
shall specify the grounds for appeal.  The appeal shall be filed within 15
calendar days of the service of the Department's determination, as required
by Section 152.04 of this Code and shall be accompanied by the payment of an
administrative fee of $35.00.  The requested hearing shall be held within 30
calendar days of the filing of the appeal following the procedures set forth
in Section 151.07 A.3. of this Code.  The hearing officer shall issue a
written decision within ten calendar days of the hearing on the appeal, with
a copy of the decision served on the landlord and the tenants by first class
mail, postage prepaid, or in person.



 



   D.   Notice of Primary Renovation Work.  Notice of Primary
Renovation Work shall be written in the language in which the original lease
was negotiated and shall provide the following information:



 



   1.   The estimated start and completion dates of any Primary
Renovation Work and Related Work associated with a Tenant Habitability Plan
accepted by the Department.



 



   2.   A description of the Primary Renovation Work and Related Work
to be performed and how it will impact that particular tenant or household.



 



   3.   The details of temporary relocation, if necessitated by the
Primary Renovation Work, and associated tenant rights under this article.



 



   4.   Instructions that tenants with questions should consult the
landlord, the Department, or the Department's designee.



 



   5.   Notice of a tenant's right to reoccupy the units under the
existing terms of tenancy upon completion of Primary Renovation Work, subject
to rent adjustments as authorized under this chapter.



 



   6.   Notice that the tenant may appeal the Department's acceptance
of a Tenant Habitability Plan in cases where the tenant does not agree with
the landlord regarding the necessity for the tenant to either be temporarily
displaced or remain in place during Primary Renovation Work, provided such
request is submitted within 15 days of the tenant's receipt of the Notice of
Primary Renovation Work.



 



 



SEC. 152.04.  NOTICE AND SERVICE REQUIREMENTS.



   (Added by Ord. No. 176,544, Eff. 5/2/05.)



 



   After the Department accepts the Tenant Habitability Plan, a landlord
shall serve a copy of the Tenant Habitability Plan, Notice of Primary
Renovation Work, a summary of the provisions of this article and, if
applicable, a permanent relocation agreement form on any tenant affected by
the Primary Renovation Work.  Service of these items shall be provided in
the manner prescribed by Section 1162 of the California Code of Civil
Procedure and at least 60 days prior to the date on which the Primary
Renovation Work and any Related Work is scheduled to begin.



 



   For purposes of the Mandatory Earthquake Reduction requirements in LAMC
Sections 91.9301, et seq., and 91.9501, et seq., and as authorized by Section
152.08 of this article, the Commission shall have the authority by regulation
to modify the service and notice requirements.  (Added by Ord. No. 183,893,
Eff. 11/22/15.)



 



 



SEC. 152.05.  PERMANENT RELOCATION ASSISTANCE.



   (Added by Ord. No. 176,544, Eff. 5/2/05.)



 



   A.   If the Primary Renovation Work and any Related Work will impact
the tenantability of a rental unit for 30 days or more, any tenant affected
by the Primary Renovation Work and Related Work shall have the option to
voluntarily terminate the tenancy in exchange for permanent relocation
assistance pursuant to Section 151.09 G. of this Code and the return of any
security deposit that cannot be retained by the landlord under applicable
law.  If the Primary Renovation Work and Related Work continues for 30 days
longer than the projected completion date set forth in the later of either
the Tenant Habitability Plan or any modifications thereto accepted by the
Department, the tenant's option to accept permanent relocation assistance
shall be renewed.  (Amended by Ord. No. 183,893, Eff. 11/22/15.)



 



   B.   A tenant may request to receive permanent relocation assistance
within 15 days of service of the Tenant Habitability Plan.  The tenant must
inform the landlord of the decision to select permanent relocation by mailing
or personally delivering a completed Permanent Relocation Agreement form to
the landlord or agents thereof.  Thereafter, the landlord shall have 15 days
to provide the tenant with relocation assistance in the manner and for the
amounts set forth in Section 151.09 G. of this Code.



 



   C.   Nothing in this section relieves the landlord from the
obligation to provide relocation assistance pursuant to an administrative
agency action or any other provision of federal, state or local law.  If a
tenant is entitled to monetary relocation benefits pursuant thereto, such
monetary benefits shall operate as credit against any other monetary benefits
required to be paid to the tenant under this section.



 



   D.   For purposes of the Mandatory Earthquake Reduction requirements
in LAMC Sections 91.9301, et seq., and 91.9501, et seq., and as authorized by
Section 152.08 of this article, the Commission shall have the authority by
regulation to extend the time provisions by up to the maximum of an
additional 180 days.  (Amended by Ord. No. 183,893, Eff. 11/22/15.)



 



 



SEC. 152.06.  TEMPORARY RELOCATION AND TEMPORARY REPLACEMENT HOUSING.



   (Added by Ord. No. 176,544, Eff. 5/2/05.)



 



   A.   The landlord shall indicate in its Tenant Habitability Plan
whether the temporary relocation of one or more tenant households is
necessary.  Pursuant to Section 152.03 of this Code, the Department
independently may determine whether temporary relocation is necessary in
conjunction with its review of the Tenant Habitability Plan.  The Department
may also require the temporary relocation of a tenant at any time during the
project if the Department determines temporary relocation is necessary to
ensure the health or safety of the tenant.



 



   B.   The temporary relocation of a tenant pursuant to this article
shall not constitute the voluntary vacating of that rental unit and shall not
terminate the status and rights of a tenant, including the right to reoccupy
the tenant's rental unit upon the completion of the Primary Renovation Work
and any Related Work.



 



   C.   A tenant who is temporarily relocated as a result of Primary
Renovation Work shall continue to pay rent in the manner prescribed by any
lease provision or accepted in the course of business between the landlord
and the tenant.



 



   D.   A landlord shall pay for all temporary housing accommodation
costs and any costs related to relocating the tenant to temporary housing
accommodations, regardless of whether those costs exceed rent paid by the
tenant.  The landlord shall also pay any costs related to returning the
tenant to his/her unit, if applicable.  The Commission may adopt guidelines
or regulations regarding the payment of moving costs.



 



   E.   A landlord may choose to place a tenant's rent and any other
required payments in an escrow account.  All costs of opening and
maintaining the escrow account shall be borne by the landlord.  Monies
deposited into the escrow account shall be distributed in accordance with
guidelines or regulations established by the Commission.  The cost of
opening an escrow account is not recoverable under Section 151.07 A.1.d. of
this Code.  (Amended by Ord. No. 177,103, Eff. 12/18/05.)



 



   F.   A landlord must temporarily relocate a tenant to habitable
temporary housing accommodations if the Primary Renovation Work and any
Related Work will make the rental unit an untenantable dwelling, as defined
in California Civil Code Section 1941.1, outside of the hours of 8:00 am
through 5:00 pm, Monday through Friday, or will expose the tenant at any time
to toxic or hazardous materials including, but not limited to, lead-based
paint and asbestos.



 



   1.   Temporary Replacement Housing Accommodations for 30 or more
consecutive days.  If the temporary relocation lasts 30 or more consecutive
days, the landlord shall make available comparable housing either within the
same building or in another building.  For purposes of this section, a
replacement unit shall be comparable to the existing unit if both units are
comparable in size, number of bedrooms, accessibility, proximity to services
and institutions upon which the displaced tenant depends, amenities,
including allowance for pets, if necessary, and, if the tenant desires,
location within five miles of the rental unit.  The landlord and tenant may
agree that the tenant will occupy a non-comparable replacement unit provided
that the tenant is compensated for any reduction in services.



 



   2.   Temporary Replacement Housing Accommodations for fewer than 30
consecutive days.  If the temporary relocation lasts less than 30
consecutive days, the landlord shall make available temporary housing that,
at a minimum, provides habitable replacement accommodations within the same
building or rental complex, in a hotel or motel, or in other external rental
housing.  The Commission may adopt guidelines or regulations regarding
temporary housing. If the temporary housing is in a hotel, motel or other
external rental housing, it shall be located no greater than two miles from
the tenant's rental unit, unless no such accommodation is available, and
contain standard amenities such as a telephone.



 



   3.   Per Diem Payment.  A landlord and tenant may mutually agree to
allow the landlord to pay the tenant a per diem amount for each day of
temporary relocation in lieu of providing temporary replacement housing. 
The agreement shall be in writing and signed by the landlord and tenant and
shall contain the tenant's acknowledgment that he/she received notice of
his/her rights under this section and that the tenant understands his/her
rights.  The landlord shall provide a copy of this agreement to the
Department.



 



   G.   The landlord shall provide written notice, before the tenant is
temporarily displaced, advising the tenant of the right to reoccupy the unit
under the existing terms of tenancy once the Primary Renovation Work and any
Related Work is completed.  Unless the landlord provides the temporary
replacement housing, the tenant shall provide the landlord with the address
to be used for future notifications by the landlord.  When the date on which
the unit will be available for reoccupancy is known, or as soon as possible
thereafter, the landlord shall provide written notice to the tenant by
personal delivery, or registered or certified mail, and shall provide a copy
of that notice to the Department.  If the tenant was temporarily relocated
for over 30 days and has a separate tenancy agreement with a third party
housing provider, the landlord shall give the tenant a minimum of 30 days
written notice to reoccupy.  In all other cases, the landlord shall give the
tenant a minimum of seven days written notice to reoccupy, unless the
landlord gave the tenant written notice of the date of reoccupancy prior to
the start of temporary relocation.



 



 



SEC. 152.07.  REMEDIES.

Tenant Habitability Plan shall be denied individual rent adjustments under
Section 151.07 A.1.(d) of this Code, absent extenuating circumstances.



 



   B.   In any action by a landlord to recover possession of a rental
unit, the tenant may raise as an affirmative defense the failure of the
landlord to comply with any provisions contained in this article.



 



   C.   Any person who willfully or knowingly with the intent to
deceive, makes a false statement or representation, or knowingly fails to
disclose a material fact in any plan or notice required under this article,
or in any declaration, application, hearing or appeal permitted under this
article, including oral or written evidence presented in support thereof,
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.



 



   Any person convicted of a misdemeanor under the provisions of this
chapter shall be punished by a fine of not more than $1,000.00 or by
imprisonment in the County Jail for a period of not more than six months or
both.  Each violation of any provision of this chapter and each day during
which such violation is committed, or continues, shall constitute a separate
offense.



 



   D.   Any person who fails to provide relocation assistance pursuant
to Section 152.05 of this Code shall be liable in a civil action to the
person to whom such assistance is due for damages in the amount of the unpaid
relocation assistance, together with reasonable attorney's fees and costs as
determined by the court.



 



   E.   Any person who breaches any duty or obligation set forth in

a tenant to reoccupy a rental unit once the primary work is completed.



 



   F.   Any agreement, whether written or oral, waiving any of the
provisions contained in this article shall be void as contrary to public
policy.



 



   G.   Nothing in this article shall be construed to deprive a person
of due process rights guaranteed by law, including, but not limited to, a

   H.   The remedies provided by this article are in addition to any
other legal or equitable remedies and are not intended to be exclusive.

order adopted pursuant to this article.



 



   B.   In order to provide sufficient time for owners to comply with
the Mandatory Earthquake Hazard Reduction requirements in LAMC Sections
91.9301, et seq., and 91.9501, et seq., the Commission may do the following:



 



   1.   Modify the service and notice requirements set forth in Section
152.04 this article; and/or



 



   2.   Grant, upon request by owner, an extension of up to 180 days
beyond the original project completion date without triggering the permanent
relocation assistance requirements set forth at Section 151.09 G. of this
Code.  Prior to granting an owner's request to extend project completion
dates, the Commission shall notify the Department of Building and Safety of
the request.  If work performed pursuant to Mandatory Earthquake Hazard
Reduction Requirements is not completed by the original project completion
date or by a subsequent date authorized by RAC, any tenant, subtenant,
lessee, sublessee, or other person(s) entitled to use and/or occupy the
building or residential unit affected by such work shall have the option to
voluntarily terminate the tenancy in exchange for permanent relocation
assistance, pursuant to Section 151.09 G., and the return of any security
deposit that cannot be retained by the owner under applicable law.



 



   C.   Before modifying service and notice requirements and/or
granting time extensions under its authority in subparagraph B. of this
section, the Commission shall find that the modifications and/or time
extensions are necessary to carry out the purpose of the Mandatory Earthquake
Hazard Reduction requirements of this Code.

SEC. 153.01.  DECLARATION OF PURPOSE.



   (Added by Ord. No. 171,074, Eff. 6/23/96.)



 



   On March 6, 1996, the Council of the City of Los Angeles adopted
recommendations from the Housing and Community Redevelopment Committee to
establish the Habitability Enforcement Program (“HEP”) substantially in
conformance with the definitions and procedures outlined in a February 14,
1996 Department report.



 



   As stated in that report, “HEP is built on the existing Rent
Reduction and REAP programs.  It is principally distinguished from the
existing programs [because a] complaint alleging [a] habitability violation
can be initiated by the tenant...[and it] allows a rent reduction and rent
escrow order to be imposed in a much shorter time frame...”



 



   HEP is a pilot program to be reviewed at the end of 18 months.  During
this 18 month period the Department will report to the Mayor and City Council
and the Department, Department of Building and Safety, and the Fire
Department will report to the Public Safety Committee on a quarterly basis on
the progress of the pilot program and any recommendations for revisions to
HEP.

SEC. 153.03.  FILING OF COMPLAINT FOR HEP, NOTIFICATION OF LANDLORD.



   (Added by Ord. No. 171,074, Eff. 6/23/96.)



 



   A.   Filing of Complaint.



 



   1.   Either a tenant or enforcement agency may initiate a complaint
with the Department alleging the existence of a habitability violation in a
residential rental unit subject to the Rent Stabilization Ordinance.  For
purposes of this division the term “enforcement agency” includes, but is
not limited to, the Health Department, the Department of Building and Safety,
Housing and Community Investment Department Code Enforcement Unit, and the
Fire Department.  (Amended by Ord. No. 182,718, Eff. 10/30/13.)



 



   2.   A complaint submitted by a tenant alleging a habitability
violation shall be submitted to the Department as follows:



 



   a.   On a form provided by the Department.



 



   b.   Include proof that the tenant has given the landlord at least
twenty (20) days prior notice of the alleged violation.



 



   c.   A declaration stating that all information provided in the
complaint form is true will be included on the form provided by the
Department pursuant to (a) above.



 



   The form shall also include language stating that “Any person who
willfully or knowingly with the intent to deceive makes a false statement or
representation, or knowingly fails to disclose a material fact, shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor.” LAMC §151.10(B)



 



   3.   When submitting a complaint, the tenant may include evidence or
documentation which supports that the habitability violation exists.



 



   B.   Acceptance of Complaint.



 



   1.   Prior to formal acceptance of the complaint from a tenant
alleging a habitability violation, the Department shall determine if:



 



   a)   the complaint alleges a deficiency which conforms with the
definition of a Habitability Violation;



 



   b)   the complaint was submitted in accordance with Subdivision 2 of
Subsection A of Section 153.03 of this Code.



 



   2.   (Amended by Ord. No. 173,810, Eff. 4/16/01.)  Upon acceptance
of the complaint from a tenant or an enforcement agency, if the complaint is
supported by an Order, then the complaint shall be treated as a referral to
the REAP and rent reduction under Section 162.03, and shall be processed
under that section.



 



   3.   (Amended by Ord. No. 173,810, Eff. 4/16/01.)  Upon acceptance
of the complaint from a tenant, if the complaint is not supported by an
Order, the Department will notify the landlord of a HEP filing and indicate
the date of the scheduled hearing, which shall be no sooner then thirty days
and no later then forty-five days from the date of the Department’s
notification.  To the extent feasible, the hearing shall be coordinated with
any General Manager’s hearing scheduled under Section 161.801et seq.



 



   4.   (Added by Ord. No. 173,810, Eff. 4/16/01.)  If the complaint
is not supported by an Order, the Department shall also refer the complaint
for inspection pursuant to Section 161.602.



 



   5.   (Added by Ord. No. 173,810, Eff. 4/16/01.)  In the event the
Department determines that the complaint was submitted in bad faith or was
frivolous, the complaint shall be denied.  The complaint is frivolous if it
is either totally and completely without merit, or is submitted for the sole
purpose of harassing an opposing party.  However, the tenant may appeal the
Department’s decision to a hearing officer and a hearing will be held on
the issue of whether or not the complaint is frivolous - not on the merits of
the complaint itself.  If a complaint is found to be frivolous by a hearing
officer, the tenant will be barred from filing an additional application
through the HEP for one year.



 



 



SEC. 153.04.  LANDLORD’S OPTIONS.



   (Added by Ord. No. 171,074, Eff. 6/23/96.)



 



   A.   Upon receipt of the notification of hearing, the landlord may
take the following steps:



 



   1.   Submit proof to the Department that the alleged habitability
violation has been corrected.  In this event, the Department shall cancel
the proposed hearing unless the tenant challenges the accuracy of the proof
filed by the landlord.  If there is a tenant challenge, then the Department
shall independently verify that the violation has been corrected prior to
canceling the hearing.



 



   2.   (Amended by Ord. No. 173,810, Eff. 4/16/01.)  Request the
Department to conduct an inspection.  This inspection shall be conducted by
referral of the complaint for inspection pursuant to Section 161.602.  If
the inspection reveals that the violation has been repaired or never existed,
then the Department shall cancel the proposed hearing.  If the results of
the inspection support the finding that the habitability violation alleged in
the complaint continues to exist, then that evidence shall be submitted to
the General Manager at the time of the hearing along with any other evidence
supplied by the tenant or the landlord.



 



   3.   Attend the hearing and provide evidence which indicates that a
habitability violation does not exist.



 



   B.   The notice to the landlord required by Subsection B of Section
153.03 shall set forth these options.



 



 



SEC. 153.05.  REFERRAL OF PROPERTY.



   (Added by Ord. No. 171,074, Eff. 6/23/96.)



 



   A.   General Manager Determination.  (Amended by Ord. No. 173,810,
Eff. 4/16/01.)  The burden is on the tenant to prove that a habitability
violation exists, except that where an Order has been issued to correct the
violation, the burden is on the landlord to show that the violation never
existed, is the fault of the tenant, or has been corrected.  If after
consideration of the facts presented at the hearing, the General Manager
determines that a habitability violation exists, the General Manager will be
authorized to issue a rent reduction and a temporary diversion of rents into
REAP.  The amount of the rent reduction will be based on a schedule approved
by the Rent Adjustment Commission.



 



   B.   Hearing Procedures.  (Amended by Ord. No. 173,810, Eff.
4/16/01.)  To the extent feasible, the Department shall follow procedures
and make findings in conformance with Article 1 of Chapter XVI of the Los
Angeles Municipal Code.



 



   C.   Appeals.  (Amended by Ord. No. 173,810, Eff. 4/16/01.)  The
landlord may appeal a decision to reduce the rent or accept the property into
REAP to the Appeals Board following the procedures set forth in Division 10
of Article 1 of Chapter XVI of this Code.



 



   D.   Additional Procedures.  (Amended by Ord. No. 173,810, Eff.
4/16/01.)  Should the General Manager order the property accepted into REAP,
a rent escrow account will be established.  The affected tenants will be
notified of their right to pay their monthly rent, minus the approved rent
reduction, into the REAP account. Additionally, they will be advised that
payment into REAP provides an affirmative defense against eviction by the
landlord for non-payment of rent.



 



   Upon placement of the property into REAP, the Department may make a
determination of the estimated cost to repair the habitability violation. 
At any time prior to the accumulation of funds in the escrow account, which
equals the estimated repair cost, the landlord may submit evidence that the
repair has been made and request reimbursement from the escrow account. 
These funds shall be released to the landlord, minus fees associated with the
administration of the escrow account.  However, if the landlord does not
effect the repairs prior to the accumulation of the repair amount, the tenant
may make the repairs with the funds held in the escrow account.  Once the
repairs have been made and all administrative costs have been collected, the
rent escrow account will be closed.



 



   Additional payments may be made from the escrow account following the
procedures set forth in Section 162.07B.



 



   E.   Exceptions.  (Added by Ord. No. 173,810, Eff. 4/16/01.)



 



   1.   No rent reduction or action to include the property into REAP
will be imposed or initiated for a temporary reduction or elimination of the
services, listed under the Habitability Violation definition above, if the
landlord can demonstrate that the reduction or elimination was necessary for
the repair, replacement or upgrade of the elevator, security gate or air
conditioning unit and the repair, upgrade or replacement was completed within
a reasonable period of time taking into account all relevant factors.



 



   2.   No rent reduction or action to include the property into REAP
will be imposed or initiated if the service reduction or elimination was not
within the reasonable control of the landlord to remedy within 20 days of the
landlord’s receipt of written notice from a tenant of the problem.  No
rent reduction or REAP action shall be ordered until such time as the service
reduction that was the subject of the complaint was within the reasonable
control of the landlord to make repairs, or, with respect to underground
parking gates only, within 60 days of the landlord’s receipt from the
tenant of written notice of the problem.

   (Article and Section Added by Ord. No. 171,761, Eff. 11/30/97.)



 



   It is the purpose of the provisions of this section to provide a
property management training program to instruct property owners on how to
improve the management of their properties.  Substandard building owners and
managers are not equipped to properly manage these properties.  The training
will encompass marketing, preparing units for rental, repair and maintenance
of the property, techniques on early detection of drug and gang activity on
the property and the use of rental agreements and leases to enforce house
rules for proper management.



 



   Owners who received substandard orders because of a multitude of
habitability violations or because they have not complied with a Department
of Building and Safety Order to Comply will benefit from the program because
these owners often lack expertise and experience in managing these properties.



 



   Further, some owners need to recognize that property ownership is a
business enterprise and in order to stay in business, the properties will
have to be managed as a business.  Property management training will be
beneficial to achieve this goal.



 



   Based on the foregoing reasons, the City Council finds that a property
management training program will improve the management of the rental units
in the City of Los Angeles thereby resulting in better managed housing stock.

to Repair for habitability violations that also violate Section 1941.1 of the
California Civil Code or for fire, life safety violations and is 45 or more
days delinquent, shall complete a City-approved property management training
program.  However, the Housing and Community Investment Department
(hereinafter “Department”) may waive this requirement where it is
established to the Department’s satisfaction that the ability to effect
repairs are beyond the landlord’s control.  (Amended by Ord. No. 182,718,

   (Article and Section Added by Ord. No. 171,884, Eff. 2/6/98.)



 



   Many Los Angeles City tenants reside in master-metered apartment
buildings and pay for essential utility service through their rent payment to
the landlord.  The landlord has the financial obligation to pay the
Department of Water and Power for utility services.



 



   A crisis now exists in the City.  There are approximately 11,000
master-metered apartment buildings whose owners have failed to pay for
utility services.  Tenants who pay rent which include the cost of utilities
face utility service termination due to the diversion of funds by the
owners.  The termination of utility service to a master-metered apartment
building would make the building uninhabitable pursuant to California Civil
Code Section 1941.1 et seq.



 



   The purpose of this ordinance is to offer tenants an alternative to
service termination in master-metered apartment buildings.  Tenants who
participate in the Utility Maintenance Program (UMP) have the option of
paying their rent into an escrow account to maintain their utility
services.  The UMP is built on the existing Rent Escrow Account Program
(REAP).

collect the utility bill due and having provided notice of utility shut-off,
may refer to the Department any building subject to the RSO that has a
delinquent utility bill and which is scheduled for termination of utility
services, thereby making the building untenantable.  The referral to the
Department shall contain the street address of the property, the type of
delinquency, the amount of the delinquency, the monthly amount required to
maintain the utility service, the name and addresses of the landlord(s), any
interested parties, any tenants as shown on the records of DWP, the number of
residential units, and any other information as required by the Department. 
DWP shall provide the Department with a preliminary title search for the
referred property.  The report shall list all persons shown on the County
Recorder records as having an ownership interest in the real property on
which the building is located.  In each referral, DWP shall specify that
non-payment of the utility bill may lead to service termination which may
render the building, or a portion thereof, untenantable.



 



   B.   Notice of Eligibility.  Within five working days after
receiving notification from DWP, the Department shall give to the
landlord(s), any interested parties, and tenants a Notice of Eligibility to
place the building into UMP.  The Notice of Eligibility shall provide
written notification to the landlord(s) of the eligibility of the building
for placement into UMP and shall list the street address of the building and
include a copy of the referral notice from DWP.  The Notice of Eligibility
shall provide a description of UMP and specify that within seven calendar
days from the date of the notice, the landlord(s) may request a General
Manager's hearing to appeal the decision to place the building into UMP.  If
no hearing is requested, the Department shall make a determination on the
eligibility of the building for acceptance in UMP.  The Notice of
Eligibility shall also state that if the building is placed into UMP, an
escrow account shall be established for the deposit of monthly rent payments,
with a non-refundable administrative fee of $50.00 per individual rent
payment and that escrow funds may be paid to DWP to maintain utility services
to avoid having the building become uninhabitable and in violation of Civil
Code Section 1941.l et seq.



 



   C.   Manner of Giving Notice.  The notices described in this
Section shall be given in writing and may be given either by personal
delivery to the landlord(s) or by deposit in the United States mail in a
sealed envelope, postage prepaid, addressed to the landlord(s) at the last
address known to DWP or the Department or as shown on the last equalized
assessment roll if not known.  Service by mail shall be deemed to have been
completed at the time of deposit in the United States mail.  The failure of
any landlord(s) or other persons to receive this notice shall not affect in
any manner the validity of any of the proceedings taken thereunder.  Proof
of giving this notice may be made by a declaration signed under penalty of
perjury by any employee of the City which shows service in conformity with
this section.  Payment arrangements reached between DWP and the landlord(s),
upon notification to the Department from DWP, shall terminate further
processing of placing the building into UMP.  A subsequent referral of the
building to the Department by DWP on this same delinquency will be directly
considered by the Department for inclusion into UMP as long as the
landlord(s) for the property had been provided the right to a Department
hearing, as stated in Subsection B. above.



 



   D.   Hearings by Hearing Officer.



 



   1.   A request for hearing shall be in writing and filed with the
Department upon a form and with the number of copies required by the
Department.  Each request for hearing shall be accompanied by a filing fee
in the amount of $50.00.



 



   2.   If a request for hearing is received by the Department within
the seven day period, then the requested hearing shall be held within ten
days of the receipt of the request by a hearing officer designated by the
Department.  Notice of the time, date and place of the hearing shall be
mailed by the Department to the applicant and tenants of the subject rental
units at least seven calendar days prior to the hearing date.



 



   3.   The hearing shall be conducted by a hearing officer designated
by the Department.  At the time of the hearing the landlord(s) and/or any
affected tenant may offer any documents, testimony, written declarations or
evidence as may be pertinent to the proceedings.



 



   4.   Hearing Officer Determination.  If after consideration of the
facts presented at the General Manager's hearing, the Hearing Officer finds
that the three factors listed in Subsection E., below, exist, the Hearing
Officer shall place the building into UMP.



 



   5.   A final decision shall be made by the Hearing Officer within 72
hours after the completion of the General Manager's hearing.  The Department
shall mail copies of the findings and determination of the Hearing Officer to
the applicant and all affected tenants.



 



   6.   Effective Date of Decision.  The final decision of the Hearing
Officer pursuant to this Subdivision shall constitute the final
administrative decision in the appeal of placement of the building into UMP.



 



   E.   Findings.  In reviewing whether a building should be included
in UMP, the Hearing Officer or Department shall find that each of the
following factors exist:



 



   1.   A delinquent utility bill exists;



 



   2.   The landlord(s) has failed to pay the delinquent utility bill;
and



 



   3.   Utility shut-off will result in the building becoming
untenantable and in violation of Civil Code Section 1941.1.



 



   F.   Department Determination Where No Hearing Is Requested.  If
the landlord(s) does not request a General Manager's hearing, the Department
shall review the file and determine whether the three factors listed in
Subsection E. above, exist.  If the Department finds that those factors
exist, the building shall be placed into UMP.

184,446, Eff. 9/28/16.)



 



   A.   Notice of Acceptance.  Within five working days of the
decision on acceptance of a building into UMP, the Department shall mail
notification of the acceptance to the landlord(s) identified in the title
report, any creditors of the landlord(s) known to the Department, DWP, any
interested parties, all tenants in the building who are known to the
Department, and the occupants of each residential unit.  The Notice of
Acceptance shall state that the building has been accepted into UMP and shall
also state the following:



 



   1.   The street address and the rent registration number, if any, of
the building;



 



   2.   The findings made pursuant to Section 155.02 E.;



 



   3.   The proposed date upon or after which an escrow account shall
be established into which tenants of the affected residential units may
deposit their rent in lieu of payment to the landlord(s);



 



   4.   That a non-refundable administrative fee of $50.00 per
residential unit per monthly rent payment shall be collected by the
Department from the escrow account;



 



   5.   That non-payment of rents into UMP within 30 days of the date
of the Notice of Acceptance by sufficient number of tenants required to
fulfill the minimum utility payment amount that DWP requires to maintain the
utility service, may result in termination of utility services by DWP;



 



   6.   Written direction to tenants of how payments may be deposited
into the escrow account;

under REAP;



 



   8.   That escrow funds will be paid to DWP to maintain the utility
services; and



 



   9.   That non-participation of tenants in UMP may result in
evacuation of the building due to utility service termination.



 



   B.   Service and Recordation.  After the decision accepting the
building into UMP becomes final, the Department shall file and record with
the County Recorder of the County of Los Angeles a certificate legally
describing the real property and stating that the subject building has been
placed into UMP and that the landlord of the building has been so notified. 
After the building has been removed from UMP, the Department shall file and
record with the County Recorder a certificate terminating the above-recorded
status of the subject building.  The Department may, by regulation, provide
for the reimbursement to the Department from the escrow account for the fees
and costs incurred.

SEC. 155.05.  ESTABLISHMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF UMP ACCOUNT.



   (Title and Section Amended by Ord. No. 181,643, Eff. 5/31/11.)



 



   A.   Within ten working days of the acceptance of a building into
UMP, the Department shall establish an escrow account for the building into
which tenants may deposit rent payments.  The Department shall mail
notification to all tenants of the existence of the account, include payment
coupons to tenants and provide an explanation of how payments may be
deposited into the account.  The Department shall provide a receipt to each
tenant making a deposit.  The Department shall provide, at least once a
month, a periodic report to the landlord(s) concerning the activity in the
account.  The records of the account shall be reasonably available to the
landlord(s) or any interested party, or their representatives, in accordance
with Department regulations, including the provision for payment of
reasonable fees, as the Department may promulgate.  Tenants shall be
informed that non-payment of rent monies into UMP or inadequate participation
by other tenants in the building may result in termination of utility
services.



 



   B.   The gross amount of payment made into the escrow account by or
on behalf of a tenant shall be deemed as a payment in the same amount to the
landlord(s), including, but not limited to, for the purpose of determining
whether a tenant has paid rent with respect to Section 151.09 A.1. of this
Code.  In any action by a landlord(s) to recover possession of a residential
unit, the tenant may raise the fact of payments into UMP as an affirmative
defense in the same manner as if those payments had been made to and accepted
by the landlord(s).




   C.   If the dominant intent of the landlord(s) in seeking to recover
possession of a residential unit is retaliation against the tenant for
exercising his or her rights under this Article, and if the tenant is not in
default as to the payment of rent, including payments into UMP, then the
landlord(s) may not recover possession of a residential unit in any action or
proceeding or cause the tenant to quit involuntarily.



 



   D.   The Department shall deduct a non-refundable administration fee
of $50.00 for each individual rent payment made into the escrow account. 
Only one fee shall be deducted for each residential unit for each month.



 



 



SEC. 155.06.  EXPENDITURE OF UMP ESCROW ACCOUNT FUNDS BY THE DEPARTMENT.



   (Title and Section Amended by Ord. No. 181,643, Eff. 5/31/11.)



 



   The funds paid into the escrow account shall only be expended on the
following items:



 



   A.   The non-refundable administrative fee of $50.00 for each rent
payment made into UMP.



 



   B.   Funds paid in accordance with a court order.



 



   C.   Funds paid to DWP for the amount required to maintain utility
services from the date of the referral pursuant to Section 155.02 A. of this
Code.



 



   D.   Funds returned to the property owner/landlord when the property
has been removed from UMP pursuant to Section 155.07 of the Code.  (Amended
by Ord. No. 184,446, Eff. 9/28/16.)



 



   E.   The Department may return funds remaining in the UMP account
for a building, to the extent legally permissible, to the tenants who
deposited such funds.  The Department shall adopt regulations with respect
to the return of funds.  (Renumbered by Ord. No. 184,446, Eff. 9/28/16.)



 



   F.   At any time after funds are paid to DWP pursuant to Subsection
C. above, a tenant may apply to the Department for a release of funds from
the escrow account.  The Department shall review the application and, after
notice and opportunity to be heard is given to the landlord, may order the
release of funds from the escrow account where it has been demonstrated to
the satisfaction of the Department that such release is necessary to prevent
a significant diminution of an essential service to the building, or is
necessary for the correction of the deficiencies.  Where specifically
ordered by a court, the Department shall order the release of funds from the
escrow account.  (Renumbered by Ord. No. 184,446, Eff. 9/28/16.)

   (Title and Section Amended by Ord. No. 181,643, Eff. 5/31/11.)



 



   A.   The Department shall administratively remove buildings from UMP
if the following conditions apply:  (Amended by Ord. No. 184,446, Eff.
9/28/16.)



 



   1.   There are no delinquent DWP bills as reported to the Department
by DWP; and



 



   2.   The building has not also been placed into REAP pursuant to
Section 162.00, et seq.; or



 



   3.   If no tenant has made payments to the UMP account during the
preceding 12 months.



 



   B.   Within ten days of the Department removing the building from
UMP, a demand will be made to the Controller of the City of Los Angeles for
the release of accumulated UMP funds to the current landlord(s) subject to
the provision of the landlord(s)'s Social Security Number or Tax
Identification Number and after deducting any outstanding fees and penalties
imposed pursuant to Article 1 of Chapter XVI and deducting any rent
registration fees owed pursuant to Article 1 of Chapter XV.



 



   C.   Tenants and all interested parties shall receive notification
of the removal of the building from UMP. Tenants will be instructed to make
rent payments to the landlord(s) for the next month's rent payment due date.

   The Department, DWP and organizations authorized by the City Council
may contact tenants.  During that contact, tenants shall be informed of the
UMP/REAP and their right to forward rent payments into the escrow account for
the maintenance of utility services, eviction protection rights, and rights
for the release of escrow funds.

   If UMP is unsuccessful in obtaining adequate tenant participation to
maintain the utility services, DWP will be notified by the Department.  DWP
shall consequently notify all interested parties of the termination of
utility services in accordance with its utility termination procedures.



 



 



SEC. 155.10.  SEVERABILITY.



   (Added by Ord. No. 184,446, Eff. 9/28/16.)



 



   If any provision of this ordinance is found to be unconstitutional or
otherwise invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, that invalidity
shall not affect the remaining provisions of this ordinance, which can be
implemented without the invalid provisions, and to that end, the provisions
of this ordinance are declared to be severable.
