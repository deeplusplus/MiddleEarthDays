   (Amended by Ord. No. 185,644, Eff. 7/6/18.)



 



   This Article shall be known as the Los Angeles Housing Code, a portion
of the Los Angeles Municipal Code.  Wherever the phrase "this Article" is
used, it shall mean the Los Angeles Housing Code.  Wherever the phrase "this
Code" is used, it shall mean the Los Angeles Municipal Code.



 



 



SEC. 161.102.  PURPOSE.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 173,011, Eff. 1/30/00.)



 



   It is found and declared that there exist in the City of Los Angeles
substandard and unsanitary residential buildings and dwelling units the
physical conditions and characteristics of which render them unfit or unsafe
for human occupancy and habitation, and which conditions and characteristics
are such as to be detrimental to or jeopardize the health, safety and welfare
of their occupants and of the public.



 



   It is further found and declared that the existence of such substandard
buildings and dwelling units threatens the physical, social and economic
stability of sound residential buildings and areas, and of their supporting
neighborhood facilities and institutions; necessitates disproportionate
expenditures of public funds for remedial action; impairs the efficient and
economical exercise of governmental powers and functions; and destroys the
amenity of residential areas and neighborhoods and of the community as a
whole.



 



   For these reasons it is hereby declared to be the policy of the City of
Los Angeles:



 



   (1)   That it is in the public interest of the people of Los Angeles
to protect and promote the existence of sound and wholesome residential
buildings, dwelling units and neighborhoods by the adoption and enforcement
of such standards, regulations and procedures as will remedy the existence or
prevent the development or creation of dangerous, substandard, or unsanitary
and deficient residential buildings and dwelling units; and



 



   (2)   That the adoption of the Los Angeles Housing Code is in the
interest of the health, safety and welfare of the people of Los Angeles.



 



 



SEC. 161.103.  SEVERABILITY.



   (Added by Ord. No. 184,446, Eff. 9/28/16.)



 



   If any provision of this ordinance and Chapter is found to be
unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction,
that invalidity shall not affect the remaining provisions of this ordinance
and Chapter, which can be implemented without the invalid provisions, and to
this end, the provisions of this ordinance are declared to be severable.

   (Amended by Ord. No. 185,644, Eff. 7/6/18.)



 



   A.   General.  Whenever it is necessary to conduct an inspection or
perform any duty under this Article or other applicable law, the General
Manager is authorized to enter any residential rental property, building,
unit or structure falling within the scope of this Article, between 8:00 a.m.
and 6:00 p.m., or any other agreed upon time reached with the person in
control or possession of the residential property, building, unit or
structure.  Before gaining entry, the General Manager shall serve a notice
pursuant to Section 161.601 B. of this Article.  However, an inspection
notice need not be served if the General Manager gains entry by obtaining the
consent of the person in control or possession of the residential rental
property, building, unit or structure, as follows:



 



   1.   If the building, unit or structure is occupied, the General
Manager shall present proper credentials to the occupant; explain the reasons
for the inspection; and request consent to conduct an inspection.



 



   2.   If the building, unit or structure is unoccupied, the General
Manager shall locate the owner or other person having charge or control of
the property, building, unit, or structure and present proper credentials;
explain the reasons for the inspection; and request consent to conduct an
inspection.



 



   B.   Inspection Notice.  Except as otherwise provided in this
Division, the General Manager shall serve an inspection notice to the
property owner/landlord and tenant in accordance with Section 161.409 of this
Article at least 30 calendar days prior to the inspection date.



 



   C.   Right to Object to an Inspection.  The property owner/landlord
and tenant may object to the inspection notice by seeking pre-compliance
judicial review.



 



   1.   Pre-compliance judicial review shall be sought at least ten
calendar days before the inspection date provided on the inspection notice in
any Court of competent jurisdiction located in the City of Los Angeles.



 



   2.   A person seeking pre-compliance judicial review of an
inspection notice shall follow the applicable rules of court, including, but
not limited to, the time for providing notice to the Department and content
and service of the notice.



 



   D.   Inspection Warrant.



 



   1.   If consent to conduct an inspection is refused or cannot be
obtained, the General Manager shall secure entry to inspect the premises by
getting an inspection warrant under California Code of Civil Procedure
Sections 1822.50 through 1822.57.



 



   2.   Notice that an inspection warrant has been obtained shall be
served by the General Manager on the property owner/landlord or tenant at
least five calendar days before the warrant is set to be executed, unless the
judge finds that immediate execution is reasonably necessary in the
circumstances shown.



 



   3.   The notice that an inspection warrant has been issued shall
include the name of the judicial officer who issued the warrant and his/her
address or department.



 



   4.   Before the date the warrant is set to be executed, the property
owner/landlord or tenant may seek judicial review of the inspection warrant
before the judicial officer who issued the warrant.



 



   E.   Exigent Circumstances.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
General Manager has reasonable cause to believe that a residential rental
property, building, unit, structure, or common area subject to this Article
is so hazardous, unsafe or dangerous as to require immediate inspection to
safeguard the public health or safety, the General Manager shall have the
right to immediately enter and inspect the premises by use of any reasonable
means to effect entry.



 



 



SEC. 161.602.  PERIODIC INSPECTIONS.

periodic inspection once every four years of all residential rental
properties, buildings, units and structures falling within the scope of this
Article.



 



   B.   Criteria for More Frequent Periodic Inspections.  The
Department shall promulgate regulations, subject to approval of the City
Council, determining when a residential rental property, building, unit, or
structure falling within the scope of this Article may be inspected more
frequently than provided in Section 161.602 A. due to a substantial risk of
violation of this Article. The regulations may include the following criteria:



 



   1.   The extent and seriousness of the current violations and any
reasonably anticipated effect on the occupants.

including whether the property has been the subject of orders issued by other
agencies concerning health and safety violations; orders imposed by the
General Manager under Division 8 of this Article; or involvement in nuisance
abatement.



 



   3.   The age of the premises.



 



   4.   The record in the past four years of the persons or entities
who own, manage or control the property with respect to health or safety
violations at the premises or other properties and whether the violations
have been subject to enforcement action.



 



   5.   Whether the property has delinquent fees imposed under Division
9 of this Article.



 



   6.   Whether there are tax defaults on the property.

utility bills in excess of 6 months.



 



   8.   Any other criteria determined by the Department to be
indicative of the existence of health or safety violations.



 



   C.   Regulations and Policies.  The General Manager may adopt
regulations and policies to implement this Section.

   (Added by Ord. No. 173,011, Eff. 1/30/00.)



 



   Whenever the Department determines by inspection that any existing
building or dwelling unit, subject to this article, or portion thereof, is in
violation of this article, the Department shall order the violation
corrected.  If the Department determines that the building or dwelling unit
is substandard pursuant to California Health and Safety Code Section 17920.3,

pursuant to that section.



 



   The order shall be provided to the owner on a standard form which in
plain language states the violations found and the sections of this Code with
which the property is not in compliance.  The order shall inform the owner
that failure to correct the violation may result in additional inspection
fees pursuant to Division 9 of this article or rent withholding as provided
by Section 161.903.3 for failure to pay those fees, inclusion in REAP and/or

rent increases as provided by Section 161.807, criminal prosecution or any
other enforcement action.  If the order declares the building or dwelling
unit to be substandard, then it shall comply with California Health and
Safety Code Section 17980(d).  (Para. Amended by Ord. No. 173,810, Eff.
4/16/01.)

the order shall be provided to each affected residential unit in the manner
prescribed by Subdivision (a) of California Health and Safety Code Section

declared to be vacant is rented, no rent is due or owing for that dwelling
unit.  The tenant may assert this Section as an affirmative defense to any

   If the violation has not been corrected by the compliance date but
significant progress has been completed, the inspector may grant a single
extension of time, not to exceed 30 days.  If upon subsequent reinspection
the violation has not been corrected but significant additional progress has
been completed since the previous inspection, the inspector’s supervisor
may grant a single additional extension of time, not to exceed 30 days.  Any
other or further extensions of time may be granted only by the General
Manager or his or her designee.  The extensions permitted by this section
are not automatic.  In determining whether to grant any extension, the
Department shall consider the criteria set forth in Section 161.602.1 and any
other criteria set forth by regulation indicating a risk of recurring
violations.

   Where the Department determines that the condition poses a present,
imminent, extreme and immediate hazard or danger to life or limb, health or
safety, it shall order abatement of the conditions within 48 hours.  No
extensions of time shall be granted except as provided by regulation. 
Within 24 hours after the time to abate, the Department shall conduct a
reinspection of the building or dwelling unit to determine compliance with
the order.  If the condition has not been abated, the Department shall have
the authority to make the necessary repairs and include the building or
dwelling unit in the Urgent Repair Program as specified in Section 50.00 of
this Code or any successor program established to ensure immediate repair of
dangerous, life threatening conditions.

   1.   The General Manager's Hearing shall be set and held following
the procedures set forth in Division 8 of Article 1 of Chapter XVI of this
Code.  To the extent feasible, the Hearing shall be coordinated with any
General Manager's Hearing scheduled under Section 161.801, et seq.  The
Department shall investigate whether there are other outstanding Orders
against the building(s), structure(s) and/or premises, and, if so, shall
provide notice of the Hearing to any additional tenants affected by those
Orders.



 



   2.   Tenants or Enforcement Agencies may present proof that the
violations specified in the Order, at the time the Order was issued, affected
additional units that have not been inspected, or that there are additional
outstanding Orders affecting the same or different units of the building,
structure and/or premises that were not included in the original Decision of
the Department.



 



   3.   The property owner/landlord may present proof that a rent
reduction is not appropriate because the violations were caused by the
tenants.  The burden shall be on the property owner/landlord to prove that
the tenants caused the violations.



 



   4.   The property owner/landlord and any tenant or Enforcement
Agency may present proof that, due to extreme circumstances, acceptance into
REAP or the rent reduction would jeopardize the health or safety of the
tenants.  The property owner/landlord has the burden of demonstrating
unique, extreme circumstances that make any requested relief appropriate. 
The Department shall scrutinize such a request with particular caution when
it is not supported by the tenants or the Enforcement Agency.



 



   5.   Before the General Manager's Hearing begins, the property
owner/landlord shall complete and submit a form provided by the Department
that sets forth the names and current rents of all of the tenants in units
subject to REAP.



 



   B.   General Manager Hearing Officer Decision.



 



   1.   The General Manager shall issue a Decision, as set forth in
Division 8 of Article 1 of Chapter XVI of this Code, within ten working days
of the hearing.



 



   2.   The General Manager may affirm, modify, or reverse the
determination of the Department.  The General Manager shall find that each
of the factors set forth in Section 162.03 exists in affirming the acceptance
of a building into REAP.  The General Manager may modify or reverse the
determination of the Department only upon making written findings setting
forth specifically either:



 



   (i)   that the action of the Department was in error or constituted
an abuse of discretion, or



 



   (ii)   there is new, relevant information which was not previously
submitted either at the time of the referral to REAP due to mistake,
surprise, inadvertence, lack of notice, or excusable neglect, which
information supports a modification or reversal.



 



   3.   If the property owner/landlord was already in compliance with
the Order before the date of General Manager's Hearing, the Department's
Decision shall be reversed.  If the Department's Decision is affirmed in the
General Manager Hearing Officer Decision, the rent reduction effective date
shall be the date of the General Manager Hearing Officer Decision. The
General Manager Hearing Officer Decision shall be the final administrative
decision unless appealed to the RAC Appeals Board pursuant to Section 162.06
C.



 



   4.   If during the General Manager's Hearing, a tenant or
Enforcement Agency presents proof that the violations specified in the Order,
at the time the Order was issued, affected additional units that had not been
inspected, or that there are additional outstanding Orders affecting the
building, structure and/or premises that were not included in the original
Decision of the Department, the General Manager may order further rent
reductions or include additional units in REAP.



 



   Prior to determining that additional units not included in the original
Decision of the Department pursuant to Section 162.04 D. will be subject to
inclusion in REAP or rent reductions, the General Manager shall, if requested
by the property owner/landlord, continue the hearing as to the additional
units in order to provide an opportunity to be heard.  The General Manager
may issue a decision as to the rental units included in the original Decision
of the Department prior to the continued hearing date or may wait and issue
one General Manager Hearing Officer Decision covering all of the units.  The
effective date of rent reductions as to units included in the original
Decision of the Department is identified in Sections 162.04 D.5. and 162.05
B.  If the hearing is continued, the effective date of rent reductions as to
additional units not included in the original Decision of the Department,
will be the date of the General Manager Hearing Officer Decision issued after
the hearing.



 



   5.   If the General Manager finds that the violations are of such a
nature or extent that they are likely to be found in or affect several units,
the General Manager may order the rent reduction extended to additional units
that were not included in the original Decision of the Department without
proof of an outstanding Order for those units.  The General Manager Hearing
Officer Decision shall state the findings justifying extending the rent
reduction to additional units.



 



   Prior to determining that additional units not included in the original
Decision of the Department pursuant to Section 162.04 D. will be subject rent
reduction, the General Manager shall, if requested by the property
owner/landlord, continue the hearing as to the additional units in order to
provide an opportunity to be heard.  The General Manager may issue a
Decision as to the rental units included in the original Decision of the
Department prior to the continued hearing date or may wait and issue one
General Manager Decision covering all of the units.



 



   6.   The General Manager may refer the building, unit or structure
for a periodic inspection pursuant to Section 161.602.  If the building has
already had a periodic inspection within the past three years, the General
Manager may order the property owner/landlord to pay an inspection fee
pursuant to Section 161.901.2.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,644, Eff. 7/6/18.)



 



   7.   Under extraordinary circumstances, the Department may delay,
reduce, stay or deny the rent reduction or escrow account, notwithstanding
that the conditions set forth in Section 162.03 have been met, when to do
otherwise would jeopardize the health or safety of the tenants or would
violate the constitutional rights of any person.  The mere reduction of
income available to make repairs shall not constitute extraordinary
circumstances.  If the Department grants that relief, the General Manager
Hearing Officer Decision shall state in detail the circumstances supporting
the relief.



 



   8.   If the General Manager Hearing Officer Decision is to affirm
the placement of the property into REAP, the property owner/landlord shall
attend a REAP workshop provided by the Department within six months of the
issuance of the Decision.  There shall be no fee assessed to attend this
workshop.



 



   C.   Appeal of General Manager Hearing Officer Decision.  The
property owner/landlord, any tenant, or the Enforcement Agency may appeal to
the RAC Appeals Board following the procedures set forth in Division 10 of
Article 1 of Chapter XVI.  If a General Manager Hearing Officer Decision to
place a property into REAP is appealed, enforcement of REAP will be stayed
until the appeal is final.  An application fee required pursuant to Section
161.1004 C.2. of this Code may be waived by the Department in accordance with
the standards and procedures set forth in Section 151.14 C.  (Amended by
Ord. No. 185,644, Eff. 7/6/18.)



 



   If the appeal is denied, the rent reduction shall be applied
retroactively to the date of the General Manager Hearing Officer Decision
pursuant to Section 162.06 B.3.



 



   If the General Manager Hearing Officer Decision imposed additional rent
reductions that were not included in the original acceptance into REAP, and
if the violations on which those reductions were based have not been
corrected by the time the appeal was filed, then the rent reduction(s) shall
be applied retroactively to the date of the General Manager Hearing Officer
Decision pursuant to Section 162.06 B.3.



 



 



SEC. 162.07.  ESCROW ACCOUNT.



   (Added by Ord. No. 173,810, Eff. 4/16/01.)



 



   A.   Establishment of Account.



 



   1.   Within five business days after the decision accepting a
building into REAP has become final, the Department shall establish as part
of the REAP Trust Fund an account for the building into which tenants may
deposit rent payments.  The Department shall mail notification to all
affected tenants of the existence of the escrow account, including an
explanation of how payments may be deposited into the account and when the
Department will begin to accept payments.  The Department shall provide a
receipt to each tenant making a deposit.  The Department shall provide, at
least once a month, a periodic report to the property owner/landlord
concerning the activity in the escrow account.  The records of the escrow
account shall be made reasonably available to the property owner/landlord or
any interested party, or their representatives, in accordance with the RAC
Regulations, including the provision for payment of reasonable fees, as the
RAC may promulgate.  (Amended by Ord. No. 184,446, Eff. 9/26/16.)



 



   2.   Interest at a rate established by the Rent Adjustment
Commission pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph a. of Subdivision 1. of
Subsection B. of Section 151.06.02 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code shall
accrue to the funds held in each account established by the Department
pursuant to the provisions of Subdivision 1. of this Section, and shall be
disbursed upon termination of the account in accordance with Subsection D. of
Section 162.08.  (Added by Ord. No. 177,119, Eff. 12/26/05.)



 



   B.   Withdrawals from Escrow Account.



 



   1.   The Department shall deduct a non-refundable administrative fee
of $50.00 for each individual rent payment made into the account.  Only one
such fee shall be deducted for each residential unit for each month.



 



   2.   A property owner/landlord, any tenant, any Enforcement Agency,
any interested party, and any creditor may apply to the General Manager for a
release of funds from the escrow account, in accordance with the regulations
the RAC shall enact.  Withdrawals may be for the following reasons, in
addition to other reasons adopted by regulation:  (Amended by Ord. No.
184,446, Eff. 9/26/16.)



 



   a.   When necessary to prevent a significant diminution of an
essential service to the building, including utilities;



 



   b.   When necessary for the correction of deficiencies, including
but not limited to those that caused the acceptance into REAP;



 



   c.   When, to the extent legally permissible, requested by a tenant
who has performed or wishes to repair conditions that affect the tenant’s
health and safety, that result in a deprivation of housing services, as
defined in Section 151.02, or that result in a habitability violation, as
defined in Section 153.02. Those repairs are not limited to the repair of
violations that caused the acceptance into REAP;



 



   d.   When requested by a tenant who wishes to or has relocated from
the unit or building.  These withdrawals are not limited to the amount of
relocation assistance permitted by the RSO;



 



   e.   When requested by a tenant who has sustained expenses due to
uninhabitable conditions; or



 



   f.   When ordered by a court.



 



   3.   Upon receipt of an application for release of funds, the
General Manager shall hold a hearing following the procedures set forth in
Division 8 of Article 1 of Chapter XVI of this Code.  The General Manager
shall order the release of funds from the escrow account where it has been
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the General Manager that the conditions
set forth in paragraph 2 above, or other conditions enacted by regulation,
have been met.  When necessary to address an imminent threat to the health
or safety of the occupants, or to prevent the termination of utilities, the
General Manager may release funds without a hearing or on shortened notice. 
The RAC shall promulgate regulations governing expedited releases.  Any
aggrieved party may appeal the General Manager’s decision to the Appeals
Board following the procedures set forth in Division 10 of Article 1 of
Chapter XVI of this Code.  An application fee required pursuant to the
provisions of Section 161.1002.2 may be waived by the Department in
accordance with the standards and procedures set forth in the provisions of
Section 151.14 C.  (Last Sentence Added by Ord. No. 177,634, Eff. 7/22/06.)



 



   4.   If a building is in more than one escrow program of the
Department (including REAP, UMP, URP or HEP) or if there are insufficient
funds to address one or more requests for release of funds, the disbursement
of funds in excess of the $50.00 administrative fee to make repairs and/or
address the health and safety of the occupants, and/or to preserve essential
services, shall be given priority over expenditures for other purposes. 
(Amended by Ord. No. 184,446, Eff. 9/26/16.)



 



   5.   The pendency of an unlawful detainer action or an unlawful
detainer judgement shall not prevent the disbursement of funds to a tenant.
The General Manager shall take into account the facts and circumstances of
the unlawful detainer action.



 



   6.   The General Manager shall deny the application where it
determines that the application is intended, in whole or in part, to
circumvent the provisions of this article.  A debt incurred subsequent to
notice to a creditor that the building was under consideration for or had
been selected for participation in REAP, shall be presumed, subject to
rebuttal, to be for the purpose of circumventing the provisions of this
article.



 



 



SEC. 162.08.  TERMINATION OF REAP.



   (Added by Ord. No. 173,810, Eff. 4/16/01.)



 



   A.   After receiving notice that all orders have been complied with
and all violations have been corrected, including but not limited to those
that caused the placement into REAP and any subsequent orders or violations,
the Department may recommend to the City Council the termination of the rent
reductions if it finds:



 



   1.   All orders affecting the units and the common areas have been
signed off by the appropriate Enforcement Agency; and



 



   2.   There are no other outstanding Orders affecting the units or
common areas of the building as set forth in Section 162.03 iii.



 



   B.   The Department may review an application from a property
owner/landlord to terminate the rent reduction for certain units,
notwithstanding the continuation of violations affecting other units, if the
conditions set forth in Subsection A. are met for those units.  The property
owner/landlord may only submit one application for each property.  The
Department shall review any application and recommend termination only if it
finds that only minor violations remain in the other units.  (Amended by
Ord. No. 184,446, Eff. 9/26/16.)



 



   C.   The Department may recommend termination of the escrow account
if, in addition to the findings in Subsection A or B, it finds that any
outstanding and non-appealable electric service and/or water charges
pertaining to the property have been paid to the satisfaction of the
Department of Water and Power of the City of Los Angeles.



 



   D.   If the City Council terminates the escrow account, any funds in
that account shall be paid in the following order:  (Amended by Ord. No.
184,446, Eff. 9/26/16.)



 



   1.   Any administrative fees authorized in Sections 162.07 B.1. and
162.12 that have not yet been collected.  Before funds in the escrow account
are paid for administrative fees, the Department shall process all
applications for release of funds from the escrow account as described in
Section 162.07 B.2.



 



   2.   Any outstanding fees, fines and penalties imposed pursuant to
Article 1 of Chapter XVI of this Code.



 



   3.   Any outstanding rent registration fees or fines in an RSO
building and any penalties pertaining thereto pursuant to Sections 151.05 and
151.15.



 



   4.   If applicable, pursuant to Section 161.901.2, prepayment of two
annual inspection fees, beyond the initial inspection and re-inspection fee
set forth in the Systematic Code Enforcement Program and Section 161.352, to
the Department for each property that was included in REAP.



 



   If there are insufficient funds in the escrow account to pay the
outstanding fees, fines and penalties in this Subsection, the property
owner/landlord at the time City Council removes the property from REAP shall
be responsible for payment of these fees, fines, and penalties.  The
Department may follow City guidelines for collections of any outstanding
fees, fines and/or penalties.



 



   Any escrow funds remaining after the expenditures as provided herein,
and upon City Council removing the Property from REAP, shall be returned to
the property owner who owned the property at the time the City Council
authorizes the termination of the escrow account.  The Department shall
refund any remaining escrow account balance to the property owner recorded
with the Los Angeles County Recorder's Office.



 



   E.   As a condition of terminating the escrow account, the City
Council may order an expedited systematic inspection pursuant to Section
161.805(6) and impose inspection fees, administrative costs and interest
pursuant to Sections 161.901.1 through 161.903.1.  The City Council may also
condition termination of the escrow account on payment of those fees or any
other unpaid fees under Subsection D.  (Amended by Ord. No. 184,446, Eff.
9/26/16.)



 



   F.   If the City Council terminates the rent reduction, the rent
will be restored to the original level 30 days after the Department mails the
tenants notice of the restoration.



 



   G.   Monitoring Program.  The City Council by resolution may
release a building from REAP with the condition that the property
owner/landlord prepay for two annual inspection as provided in Subsection D.
herein for the purposes of monitoring the property.  (Amended by Ord. No.
184,446, Eff. 9/26/16.)



 



 



SEC. 162.09.  TENANT PROTECTIONS.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 184,446, Eff. 9/26/16.)



 



   A.   Evictions.



 



   1.   The gross amount of payment made into the escrow account by or
on behalf of a tenant shall be deemed as a payment in the same amount to the
property owner/landlord, including, but not limited to, for the purpose of
determining whether a tenant has paid rent as provided in Section 151.09 A.1.
of this Code and/or state law.  In any action by a property owner/landlord
to recover possession of a residential unit, the tenant may raise the fact of
payments into a REAP escrow account as an affirmative defense in the same
manner as if the payments had been made to and accepted by the property
owner/landlord.



 



   2.   While a unit is in REAP, before bringing an action to recover
possession on the basis of nonpayment of rent, the property owner/landlord
shall have a duty to verify in writing with the Department that the tenant
has not paid his or her rent to a Department escrow account.  The Department
shall respond within three business days to any request for verification. 
The property owner/landlord shall not bring an action to recover possession
on the basis of nonpayment of rent without making this inquiry or if the
tenant or the Department presents proof that the tenant has paid the rent
demanded to the Department.  The violation of this section shall not be a
misdemeanor.



 



   3.   Regardless whether the unit is covered by the RSO, until the
unit is removed from REAP and for 180 days thereafter, or until expiration of
the period called for under Section 161.806, if applicable, whichever is
later, the property owner/landlord may bring an action to recover possession
of the unit only upon the grounds set forth in Section 151.09 A.



 



   4.   If the intent of a property owner/landlord in seeking to
recover possession of a rental unit is retaliation against a tenant or
Enforcement Agency's exercise of rights and/or duties under this Article, and
if the tenant is not in default as to the payment of rent, then the property
owner/landlord may not recover possession of a rental unit in any action or
proceeding or cause the tenant to quit voluntarily.  Until the unit is
removed from REAP and for one year thereafter, the property owner/landlord
shall have the burden of proving that any action to recover possession, other
than one based on nonpayment of rent, is not brought for the purposes of
retaliation.



 



   5.   In any action by a property owner/landlord to recover
possession of a rental unit, the tenant may raise as a defense any grounds
set forth in this Section.  If the tenant is the prevailing party, he or she
shall be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.



 



   B.   Rent Increases.



 



   1.   Until the unit is removed from REAP and for one year
thereafter, or until expiration of the period called for under Section
161.807, if applicable, whichever is later, the landlord or any subsequent
landlord shall not increase the rent for any current or subsequent tenant
except as provided by the Costa Hawkins Rental Housing Act, Civil Code
Section 1954.50, et. seq., and/or applicable state law.



 



   2.   If the unit is covered by Chapter XV of the Los Angeles
Municipal Code (Rent Stabilization Ordinance), no rent increase shall be
allowed pursuant to Section 151.07 for reimbursement of costs for any
corrections necessary to comply with the Order that resulted in the placement
into REAP or any additional Orders issued while in REAP.



 



   C.   Civil Actions.  Any property owner/landlord who violates any
of the provisions of this section or who retaliates against a tenant or an
Enforcement Agency for the exercise of rights and/or duties under this
article shall be liable in a civil action for damages and a penalty of $1,000
per violation, together with reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.  Any
judgment awarded in such an action may be collected from the escrow account
upon application as set forth in Section 162.07 B.



 



 



SEC. 162.10.  CONTACT WITH TENANTS.



   (Added by Ord. No. 173,810, Eff. 4/16/01.)



 



   The Department may contact the tenants of any property before or after
placement into REAP.  This contact may be in person or by mail or by both,
and the Department may contract with other persons or organizations to carry
out this activity.  During this contact, the tenants shall be informed of
the principal provisions of REAP, of the mechanism for payment into the
escrow account by tenants of untenantable residential units where the
building is accepted into REAP, and of their legal rights with respect to
eviction and rent increases under the provisions of this article and the RSO.



 



 



SEC. 162.11.  RECORDING OF REAP ORDER AND TERMINATION OF REAP.



   (Added by Ord. No. 173,810, Eff. 4/16/01.)



 



   After the decision accepting the building into REAP becomes final, the
Department shall file and record with the County Recorder of the County of
Los Angeles a certificate legally describing the real property and stating
that the subject building has been placed into REAP and that the owner of the
building has been so notified.  After the building has been removed from
REAP, the Department shall file and record with the County Recorder a
certificate terminating the above-recorded status of the subject building. 
The Department may, by regulation, provide for the reimbursement to the
Department from the escrow trust account for the fees and costs incurred.



 



 



SEC. 162.12.  COLLECTION OF REAP FEES.



   (Added by Ord. No. 175,890, Eff. 5/12/04.)



 



   The Department shall collect a non-refundable administrative fee of
$50.00 per residential unit accepted into REAP per month.  Upon acceptance
into REAP, owners shall be notified of the information contained in this
Section.



 



   A.   REAP Administrative Fees:  For each individual rent payment
made into the escrow account, the administrative fee of $50.00 per unit per
month shall be collected from the escrow account in accordance with Section
162.07 B.1.  For units in which the tenant has not made individual rent
payments into the escrow account, the administrative fee of $50.00 per unit
shall be billed to the property owner/landlord by the Department.  If
administrative fees are unpaid, they may be collected from the escrow
account.  (Amended by Ord. No. 184,446, Eff. 9/26/16.)



 



   B.   Collection of Fees:  For units in which the $50.00
administrative fee has not been paid, the fee may be collected from the
escrow account in accordance with Section 162.08 D.  (Amended by Ord. No.
184,446, Eff. 9/26/16.)



 



   C.   Collection Remedies:  All fees and costs incurred pursuant to
Section 162.12 shall be a personal obligation against the property
owner/landlord that owned the property on the date that City Council removes
the property from REAP, recoverable by the City in an action before any court
of competent jurisdiction.  In addition to the personal obligation and all
other remedies provided by law, the City may collect any judgment, fee cost,
penalty, or charge, including any permit fees, fines, late charges, or
interest, incurred in relation to the provisions of this Section 162.12 as
provided in Los Angeles Administrative Code Sections 7.35.1 through 7.35.8. 
(Amended by Ord. No. 184,446, Eff. 9/26/16.)



 



   D.   Delinquent Fees and Late Fines:  Fees are due per unit, for
each month, including partial months, that the unit remains in REAP and is
inhabited.  Fees not paid by the owner within 60 days from the last day of
each month that fees are due are deemed delinquent. A late fine may be
imposed on delinquent fees equal to 100 percent of the amount due, if the
owner is notified in accordance with Subsection E.  Interest may also be
charged where an owner fails to pay the fee or late fine, if the owner is
notified in accordance with Subsection E.  Interest shall be calculated at
the rate of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount of the
fee and late fine imposed, from the date the fee became delinquent until the
date of payment. 



 



   E.   Notice of Late Fine:  If the Department determines pursuant to
Subsection D that late fines and interest are due, then it shall notify the
owner by United States mail in a sealed envelope, with postage paid,
addressed to the last known address of the owner as that address appears in
the last equalized assessment roll.  The Department may also take reasonable
steps to determine the address of the current owner.  The notice of late
fine shall state the amount of the fee due and that:



 




"if the fee is not remitted to the Department within 30 days after the date
of mailing of this notice, the Department shall assess a late fine equal to
100 percent of the fee due.  Any person who fails to pay the assessed fee
and late fine shall also pay interest.  Interest shall be calculated at the
rate of one percent per month, or fraction of a month, on the amount of the

SEC. 163.03.  RESPONSIBILITIES OF ENFORCEMENT AGENCY.



 



   A.   Unless the Enforcement Agency determines that the tenants are
not eligible for relocation benefits pursuant to the provisions of Section
163.02 above, the Enforcement Agency shall issue an order requiring the
landlord to pay relocation benefits in the amounts specified in Section
163.05.  The order shall direct that relocation assistance be paid in the
time set forth in Section 163.04, and the Enforcement Agency shall provide
notice of the order to the landlord and the tenants in the manner set forth
in that section.  If possible, the order to pay relocation benefits shall be
made simultaneously with the issuance of the order to vacate.  When ordering
the landlord to pay the relocation benefits, the Enforcement Agency shall
adhere to the procedures set forth in Section 163.04.



 



   B.   Any order to vacate issued by an Enforcement Agency shall be
accompanied by a summary of the provisions of California Health and Safety
Code Section 17975 et seq.  Failure to provide a summary shall not relieve
any person of the obligations imposed by this article.  (Amended by Ord. No.
184,336, Eff. 7/19/16.)



 



   C.   Any order to pay relocation assistance shall advise the
landlord of the appeals process by which the landlord may challenge the
determination of the Enforcement Agency.



 



   D.   Where the landlord fails, neglects, or refuses to comply with
an order to pay relocation benefits, the City, acting through the General
Manager of the Enforcement Agency, may advance relocation benefits to
displaced tenants and recover the advanced amount, penalties and costs from
the landlord.  If the total amount of relocation benefits advanced pursuant
to Section 163.05 exceeds $100,000 per property, the General Manager must
obtain the concurrence of the Mayor and City Council before advancing
benefits to displaced tenants.  (Sentence Amended by Ord. No. 182,768, Eff.
12/13/13.)  The landlord shall be liable to the City of Los Angeles for
reimbursement of the relocation benefits plus a penalty in the amount of
one-half of the benefits paid, not to exceed $10,000, and the costs of the
Enforcement Agency as set forth in California Health and Safety Code Section
17975 et seq.  (Sentence Amended by Ord. No. 181,744, Eff. 7/15/11.)  The
City may collect the reimbursement, penalties and costs in the manner set
forth in that section, including the imposition of a lien on the property.



 



   E.   The General Manager of the Enforcement Agency is empowered and
designated to hear and adjudicate any appeal brought by a landlord from an
order requiring payment of relocation benefits.  The Enforcement Agency's

from the General Manager's decision.  The General Manager and the
Enforcement Agency's Appeals Board shall adhere to the requirements of
California Health and Safety Code Section 17975 et seq.  (Amended by Ord.

SEC. 163.04.  WHEN RELOCATION BENEFITS ARE REQUIRED TO BE PAID.



 



   A.   The relocation benefits required by this article shall be paid
by the landlord to the tenant within ten days after the date that the order
to vacate is first mailed to the landlord and posted on the premises, or at
least 20 days prior to the vacation date set forth in the order to vacate,
whichever occurs later.  (Amended by Ord. No. 184,336, Eff. 7/19/16.)



 



   B.   If there are fewer than ten days between the first posting and
mailing of the order to vacate and the vacation date, the relocation benefits
shall be paid by the landlord to the tenant within 24 hours after the notice
is posted and mailed.  The Enforcement Agency shall attempt to provide
either telephonic or written notice to the landlord to notify the landlord
that the benefits are payable immediately.  Failure to provide notice as
specified in this section shall not relieve the landlord of any obligations
imposed by this article.  (Amended by Ord. No. 184,336, Eff. 7/19/16.)



 



   C.   If a tenant is entitled to relocation benefits pursuant to
Section 163.02 above, the Enforcement Agency shall provide either telephonic
or written notice to the tenant of his or her entitlement to the benefits. 
Written notice may be satisfied by posting a written notice on the premises
stating that tenants may be entitled to relocation benefits.



 



 



SEC. 163.05.  AMOUNT OF RELOCATION BENEFITS.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 184,336, Eff. 7/19/16.)



 



   The relocation payment shall be made available by the landlord to the
tenant in each residential unit and shall be in the amounts set forth in
Section 151.09 G. of this Code, or in an amount equal to the sum of two
months of the established fair market rent for the Los Angeles/Long Beach
area as determined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development
pursuant to Section 1437(f) of Title 42 of the United States Code, whichever
amount is greater.



 



   Beginning on July 1, 2005, the relocation amount for qualified and all
other tenants shall be adjusted on an annual basis pursuant to the formula
set forth in Section 151.06 D.  The adjusted amount shall be rounded to the
nearest fifty-dollar increment.  If the relocation payment is based on the
established fair market rent for the Los Angeles/Long Beach area as
determined by the Department of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to
Section 1437(f) of Title 42 of the United States Code, then the relocation
payment shall also include an amount, as determined by the Enforcement
Agency, sufficient for utility service deposits.  The relocation benefits
shall be paid by the landlord in addition to the return, as required by law,
of any security deposits held by the landlord.  The relocation benefits
shall be made on a per residential unit basis.



 



 



SEC. 163.06.  ENFORCEMENT.



 



   A.   If the landlord fails, neglects or refuses to make timely
payments to a tenant pursuant to an order to pay relocation benefits, except
in the situations described in Sections 163.02 B. or 163.02 C., and if the
tenant does not receive relocation payments from the City, the landlord shall
be liable to the tenant in a civil action for an amount equal to one and
one-half times the relocation benefits payable pursuant to Section 163.05. 
The tenant shall also be entitled to recover reasonable attorneys’ fees and
costs as determined by a court.



 



   B.   Subsection A. of this section shall not apply when relocation
benefits are payable fewer than ten days after the date the order to vacate
is first mailed and posted on the premises, if the landlord makes the payment
no later than ten days after the order is first mailed and posted.



 



 



SEC. 163.07.  PAYMENT OF RELOCATION BENEFITS BY THE CITY.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 184,336, Eff. 7/19/16.)



 



   A.   If the landlord fails, neglects or refuses to pay relocation
payments to a tenant displaced or subject to displacement pursuant to an
order to vacate except in the situations described in Section 163.02 B. or
163.02 C. above, the City may advance relocation payments to the tenants in
the amount set forth in Section 163.05 above.



 



   B.   If the landlord fails to comply with an order to pay relocation
assistance, the landlord shall be liable to the City for any relocation
payments advanced, other than any payments made pursuant to Section 163.02
D., in the amount of the payments plus a penalty in the amount set forth in
California Health and Safety Code Section 17975.5(a).  The Enforcement
Agency may place a lien against the property as set forth in California
Health and Safety Code Section 17975.5(b).



 



   C.   Prior to instituting any action to collect from the landlord or
to impose a lien on the property, the Enforcement Agency shall send an
accounting to the landlord as set forth in California Health and Safety Code
Section 17975.  The landlord may contest the accounting within 20 days after
receipt by filing a written request for a General Manager's hearing. 
However, if there are fewer than ten days between the first posting and
mailing of the order to vacate and the vacation date, and if the City
advances relocation benefits to any tenants prior to the expiration of the
ten-day period, the landlord shall have 30 days to file a written request
contesting the charge after the itemized accounting is mailed.



 



   D.   If the request is filed within the time set forth in Subsection
163.07 C. above, the General Manager shall hold a hearing following the
procedures for the Enforcement Agency.  Any person aggrieved by the decision
of the General Manager may appeal to the Appeals Board following the
procedures for that Enforcement Agency.  If the landlord fails to obtain a
more favorable decision than that set forth in the itemized accounting, he or
she shall be liable to the City for the costs of the administrative hearing
and appeal, not to exceed $5,000.  If the accounting is not appealed as set
forth in this paragraph, it is final and is subject to California Code of
Civil Procedure Section 1094.5.  The failure to receive the itemized
accounting shall not relieve the landlord of any obligation to the City.



 



   E.   Nothing this in article shall be construed to require the
Enforcement Agency to pay any relocation benefits to any tenant, or assume
any obligation, requirements or duty of the landlord pursuant to this article.

SEC. 164.01.  PURPOSE AND INTENT.



 



   The purpose of this article is to promote the health, safety and
welfare of the residents, workers, visitors and property owners of the City
of Los Angeles, as well as protect the economic stability, viability and
livability of neighborhoods in the City by requiring the registration and
monitoring of defaulted and foreclosed residential properties. This
Foreclosure Registry Program will also protect the public from health and
safety hazards while reducing further compromise of neighboring property
values resulting from the neglect and deterioration of real property.



 



   It is the intent of the Los Angeles City Council, through the adoption
of this article, to maintain a residential property registration program as a
mechanism to protect residential neighborhoods from becoming blighted through
the lack of adequate maintenance and security of residential properties. The
Council further intends, through adoption of this article, to provide for the
proactive inspection of foreclosed residential properties to assist in
neighborhood stabilization efforts, because such properties have an increased
potential to become blighted.
