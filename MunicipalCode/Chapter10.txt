   (f)   Service by Mail – Time of Taking Effect.  Wherever service
by mail is authorized by this article, such service shall be effective on the
date of mailing if a letter containing the required papers or notice is
mailed, postage prepaid, addressed to the applicant or permittee at the

SEC. 102.03.  HEARING ON REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION OF PERMIT – INITIATION
BY ACCUSATION.



 



   A hearing to determine whether a permit should be revoked, suspended
limited, or conditioned shall be initiated by filing an accusation.  The
accusation shall be a written statement of charges which shall set forth in
ordinary and concise language the acts or omissions with which the respondent
is charged, to the end that the respondent will be able to prepare his
defense.  It shall specify the statutes and rules which the respondent is
alleged to have violated but shall not consist merely of charges phrased in
the language of such statutes and rules.  The accusation shall be verified
unless made by a public officer acting in his official capacity or by a duly
appointed representative of the Board.  The verification may be on
information and belief.



 



 



SEC. 102.04.  SERVICE OF ACCUSATION.



 



   Upon the filing of an accusation the Board shall serve a copy thereof
on the respondent.



 



   (a)   Method of Service.  The accusation may be served on the
respondent by the following means:



 



   1.   Personally, or



 



   2.   By Certified mail.  (Amended by Ord. No. 116,065, Eff. 7/2/60.)



 



   (b)   Proof of Service, Time of Taking Effect.  Service may be
proved in the manner authorized in civil actions.  Service by certified mail
shall be elective on the date of mailing if a certified letter containing the
accusation is mailed, postage prepaid, and addressed to the respondent at the
latest address on file with the Board. (Amended by Ord. No. 116,065, Eff.
7/2/60.)



 



   (c)   Appearance – Objections to Service Waived.  Where a
respondent files a notice of defense or otherwise appears in a proceeding,
all objections to the validity of service shall be deemed waived.



 



   (d)   Form of Accusation.  The copy of the accusation shall include
or be accompanied by a statement that respondent may request a hearing by
filing a notice of defense as provided in Sec. 102.05 within 10 days after
service upon him of the accusation, and that failure to do so will constitute
a waiver of his right to a hearing.  The Board shall include with the
accusation a post card or other form entitled, “Notice of Defense,” which
when signed by or on behalf of the respondent and returned to the Board, will
acknowledge service of the accusation and constitute a notice of defense
under Sec. 102.05.



 



 



SEC. 102.05.  NOTICE OF DEFENSE.



 



   (a)   Time of Filing.  Within 10 days after service upon him of the
accusation the respondent may file with the Board one or more notices of
defense in which he may:



 



   1.   Request a hearing;



 



   2.   Object to the accusation upon the ground that it does not state
acts or omissions upon which the Board may proceed;



 



   3.   Object to the form of the accusation on the ground that it is
so indefinite or uncertain that he can not identify the transaction or
prepare his defense;



 



   4.   Admit the accusation in whole or in part.



 



   (b)   Failure to File – Waiver.  The respondent shall be entitled
to a hearing on the merits if he files a notice of defense within 10 days,
and any such notice shall be deemed a specific denial of all parts of the
accusation not expressly admitted. Failure to file such notice shall
constitute a waiver of respondent’s rights to a hearing, but the Board in
its discretion may nevertheless grant a hearing.  Unless objection is taken
as provided in this section, all objections to the form of the accusation
shall be deemed waived.



 



   (c)   Written Notice of Defense.  The notice of defense shall be in
writing signed by or on behalf of the respondent and shall state his mailing
address.  It need not be verified or follow any particular form.

   At any time before the matter is submitted for decision the Board or
hearing examiner may file or permit the filing of an amended or supplemental
accusation.  All parties shall be notified thereof. If the amended or
supplemental accusation presents new charges the Board shall afford
respondent a reasonable opportunity to prepare a defense thereto.  Any new
charges shall he deemed controverted, and any objections to the amended or
supplemental accusation may be made orally and shall be noted in the record.



 



 



SEC. 102.07.  NOTICE OF HEARING.



 



   The Board shall deliver or mail a notice of hearing to all parties at
least five days prior to the hearing.  The hearing shall not be prior to the
expiration of the time within which the respondent is entitled to file a
notice of defense. The respondent may file a written waiver of time and
request an immediate hearing.



 



   (a)   Notice of Hearing – Form.  The notice to respondent shall
be substantially in the following form but may include other information:



 




   You are hereby notified that a hearing will be held before the (Board

authorized and empowered to summon witnesses for hearings by requesting the
City Clerk, pursuant to Charter Section 217(Amended by Ord. No. 173,300, Eff.
6/30/00, Oper. 7/1/00.) to issue subpoenas requiring the attendance of such
witnesses at a time and place specified.



 



   (b)   Affidavit Required.  The Board, any Board member, the
Secretary of the Board, or the hearing examiner may summon witnesses for
hearings at the request of any party to a proceeding under this article.  A
party to a proceeding under this article desiring the issuance of a subpoena
shall make a written request for the subpoena accompanied by an affidavit
specifying the name and address of the proposed witness and setting forth in
full detail the materiality of his testimony.  If the party seeks a subpoena
duces tecum, the affidavit shall specify in addition the exact matters or
things desired to be produced, and set forth in full detail the materiality
thereof to the issues involved in the case, and state that the witness has
the desired matters or things in his possession or under his control.



 



   (c)   Penalties.

   (b)   Rights of Parties.  Each party shall have these rights:



 



   1.   To call and examine witnesses;



 



   2.   To introduce exhibits;



 



   3.   To cross-examine opposing witnesses on any matter relevant to

cross-examination.



 



   (d)   Test of Relevancy.  Any relevant evidence shall be admitted
if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to
rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any
common law or statutory rule which might make improper the admission of such
evidence over objection in civil actions.



 



   (e)   Hearsay Evidence.  Hearsay evidence may be used for the
purpose of supplementing or explaining any direct evidence but shall not be
sufficient in itself to support a finding unless it would be admissible over
objection in civil actions.



 



   (f)   Privilege.  The rules of privilege shall be effective to the
same extent that they are now or hereafter may be recognized in civil action.

hearing shall be informed of the matters to be noticed, and these matters

be given a reasonable opportunity on request to refute the officially noticed
matters by evidence, or by written or oral presentation of authority, the
manner of such refutation to be determined by the Board or the hearing
examiner.

   The Board or hearing examiner may order amendment of the accusation
after submission of the case for decision. Each party shall be given notice
of the intended amendment and opportunity to show that he will be prejudiced
thereby unless the case is reopened to permit the introduction of additional
evidence in his behalf.  If such prejudice is shown, the Board or hearing
examiner shall reopen the case to permit the introduction of additional
evidence.



 



 



SEC. 102.13.  METHOD OF DECISION IN CONTESTED CASES.



 



   (a)   Hearing Before Board Itself.  Where a contested case is heard
before the Board itself, no member thereof who did not hear the evidence or
has not read the record or proceedings shall vote on the decision.



 



   (b)   Hearing Before Examiner.  If a contested case is heard by a
hearing examiner alone, he shall, within 30 days, submit a written report to
the Board.  Such report shall contain a brief summary of the evidence
considered and shall state the examiner’s conclusions and
recommendations.  The report shall contain a proposed decision, in such form
that it may be adopted by the Board as its decision in the case.  All
examiners’ reports shall be filed by the Board as a public record.  A copy
of such proposed decision so filed shall then be mailed to each party.



 



   (c)   Consideration of Report by Board – Notice.  The Board shall
fix a time when the Board will consider the report.  Notice thereof shall be
mailed to each interested party not less than 12 days prior to the date
fixed, unless it is otherwise stipulated.  (Amended by Ord. No. 161,747,
Eff. 12/14/86.)



 



   (d)   Exceptions to Report.  Not later than six days before the
date to consider the report any party may file written exceptions to any part
or all of the Examiner’s report and may attach thereto a proposed decision
together with written arguments in support of such decision.  By leave of
the Board, any party may present oral argument to the Board. (Amended by Ord.
No. 161,747, Eff. 12/14/86.)



 



   (e)   Disposition by Board.  The Board may adopt or reject the
proposed decision in its entirety, or may increase or reduce the proposed
penalty and may adopt the balance of the proposed decision of the hearing
examiner.



 



   (f)   Proposed Decision Not Adopted.  If the proposed decision is
not adopted as provided in Subsection (e), the Board may decide the case upon
the record including the transcript either in whole or in part, with or
without taking additional evidence, or may refer the case to the same or
another hearing examiner to take additional evidence.  If the case is so
assigned to a hearing examiner, he shall prepare a report and proposed
decision as provided in Subsection (b) upon the additional evidence and the
transcript and other papers which are part of the record of the prior
hearing.  Consideration of such proposed decision by the Board shall comply
with the provisions of this section.

   (d)   Hearing before the Panel.  (Amended by Ord. No. 173,283, Eff.
6/26/00, Oper. 7/1/00.)  The Board may refer to the Police Permit Review
Panel any matter within the Board’s jurisdiction relating to the issuance,
denial, suspension, revocation, or conditioning of any permit, or relating to

consider any report and shall exercise all of the powers and have all of the
duties of the Board with respect to the case.



 



   (e)   Tobacco Retailer’s Permit Administrative Review.  Matters
referred to the Police Permit Review Panel pursuant to Section 46.100 of this

SEC. 102.14.  FORM OF DECISION – FINDINGS – COPIES TO PARTIES.



 



   The decision shall be in writing and shall contain findings of fact, a
determination of the issues presented and the penalty, if any.  The findings
may be stated in the language of the pleadings or by reference thereto. 
Copies of the decision shall be delivered to the respondents personally or

SEC. 102.15.  EFFECTIVE DATE OF DECISION.



 



   The decision shall become effective 15 days after it is delivered or
mailed to respondent unless a reconsideration is ordered within that time, or
the Board orders that the decision shall become effective sooner, or a stay
of execution is granted.



 



 



SEC. 102.16.  DEFAULTS AND UNCONTESTED CASES.



 



   If the respondent fails to file a notice of defense or fails to appear
at the hearing, the Board may take action based upon the respondent’s
express admissions or upon other evidence, and affidavits may be used as
evidence without any notice to respondent; and where the burden of proof is
on the respondent to establish that he is entitled to the Board action
sought, the Board may act without taking evidence. Nothing herein shall be
construed to deprive the respondent of the right to make any showing by way
of mitigation.  (Amended by Ord. No. 158,410, Eff. 11/27/83.)



 



 



SEC. 102.17.  RECONSIDERATION.



 



   The Board may order a reconsideration of all or part of the case on its
own motion or on petition of any party.  The power to order a
reconsideration shall expire 15 days after the delivery or mailing of a
decision to respondent, or on the date set by the Board as the effective date
of the decision if such date occurs prior to the expiration of the 15-day
period.  If no action is taken on a petition within the time allowed for
ordering reconsideration the petition shall be deemed denied.



 



   (a)   Procedure on Reconsideration.  The case may be reconsidered
by the Board on all the pertinent parts of the record and such additional
evidence and argument as may be permitted, or may be assigned to a hearing
examiner.  A reconsideration assigned to a hearing examiner shall be subject
to the procedure provided in Sec. 102.13.  If oral evidence is introduced

   A request for an annual permit renewal must be accompanied by a
completed renewal form.

   Any change or alteration in the nature or operation of the business
will require the renewal to be reviewed by the Board.  Any changed
circumstance, which would have been grounds for denial of the application,
suspension or revocation of the permit, is grounds for denying the permittee
a renewed permit.  Denial of a renewal permit under this section shall
proceed in accordance with the procedures set out in Sections 103.32 and
103.33.



 



 



SEC. 103.06.2.  TEMPORARY PERMITS.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 176,066, Eff. 8/8/04)



 



   The Board may issue a temporary permit upon the acceptance of a
complete application pursuant to Section 103.02.1(d) pending its action on an
application.  A temporary permit shall expire upon the Board's action on the
application or the withdrawal of the application by the applicant.



 



   The Board may also issue a temporary permit if a permittee or applicant
seeks judicial review pursuant to Section 103.34.2.  Within ten business
days after the Board mails its final decision, the permittee may file a
written application to the Board for a temporary permit pending judicial
review.  Within seven business days of acceptance of the application, the
Board shall render its decision.  If required to do so by law, the Board
shall grant the temporary permit.  This temporary permit shall expire when a
court of competent jurisdiction renders a final decision in the litigation. 
In addition to any other grounds to suspend or revoke a temporary permit, the
Board may revoke a temporary permit if the permittee fails to diligently
pursue the judicial action.



 



   In the event the Board denies an application for a temporary permit
pending judicial review or the permittee rejects the board's proposed
conditions, the original permit shall expire no sooner than 38 days from the
mailing of the Board's action.



 



   In issuing any temporary permit, the Board may impose conditions upon
the permit as the Board finds necessary to assure the preservation of the
public health and safety.



 



 



SEC. 103.07.  PERMITS – ANNUAL FEE.



 



   (a)   Annual Police Permit Fee – Payable.  The annual police
permit fees required by this article for existing police permits shall become
due and payable each year during the two months next preceding the first day
of January of the calendar year for which annual police permit fee is paid. 
(Amended by Ord. No. 137,438, Eff. 11/7/68.)



 



   (b)   Late Filing – Discretion of Board.  The Board may, in its
discretion, authorize the acceptance of an annual police permit fee paid
within 15 days after the annual police permit is due if the Board finds that
the failure to pay said fee within the time allowed was due to inadvertence
or excusable neglect. (Amended by Ord. No. 137,438, Eff. 11/7/68.)



 



   (c)   Late Filing – Veterans.  Whenever a person who previously
held a permit but failed to pay the prescribed fee within the time provided,
shows to the satisfaction of the Board that his failure to pay such fee
within the time provided herein resulted from his induction or entrance into
the armed forces of the United States, or of any allied nation, and that the
application for a permit is made within six months after the applicant’s
honorable discharge from the service, the annual police permit fee only shall
be charged thereof. (Amended by Ord. No. 137,438, Eff. 11/7/68.)



 



   (d)   Late Filing – Effect.  (Amended by Ord. No. 143,868, Eff.
10/23/72.)  If the annual police permit fee is not received within the time
allowed in Subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this section, the permit shall
terminate and the former permittee shall cease engaging in the trade,
business or occupation for which the permit was required.  Application for a
new permit may be made as set forth in this article.



 



   The application shall be considered as an original application for a
permit and the fee shall be that prescribed for the issuance of an original
permit.



 



   (e)   Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection (a), annual
police permit fees, except those owed by Firearms Vendors and Firearms
Salespersons, required by this article to be paid for the year 2003, shall
become due and payable on June 30, 2003.  (Amended by Ord. No. 175,281,

   (Amended by Ord. No. 175,676, Eff. 1/11/04.)



 



   A permit issued by the Board may not be sold, transferred, or assigned
by any permittee or by operation of law, to any other person, group,
partnership, corporation, or any other entity.  Any sale, transfer, or
assignment or attempted sale, transfer, or assignment shall be deemed to
constitute a voluntary surrender of the permit and the permit shall
thereafter be null and void.  A permit held by a corporation or partnership
or other business entity is subject to the same rules of transferability as
stated above.  A new permit shall be required for a transfer of stock that
causes a change in the controlling interest in a corporate permittee, and for
a change in the majority ownership of a partnership or other legal entity,
whether by sale, exchange or other means.

on a permit by the Board upon written application by a permittee accompanied
by the change of location fee prescribed in Section 103.12.



 



   The fee imposed by this section shall not apply to the relocation of a
business from a building or structure which was damaged or destroyed as a
result of the earthquake of January 17, 1994 and its aftershocks, as
determined by the Department of Building and Safety.  (Paragraph Added by
Ord. No. 170,126, Eff. 12/29/94.)

   (a)   Decision on Application.  Subject to Section 103.29.01, the
Board shall act to either grant a Police Permit or deny an application
pursuant to the grounds set forth in Section 103.31:

SEC. 103.29.01.  EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR ACTION ON APPLICATION.



   (Added by Ord. No. 181,776, Eff. 8/22/11.)



 



   The Executive Director is authorized to act on behalf of the Board to
grant a Police Permit, except for applications made pursuant to Sections
103.101.1, 103.102 and 103.109, pursuant to the following:



 



   (a)   If the recommendation of the Department is to grant a Police
Permit without conditions, or with conditions to which the applicant agrees,
the Executive Director, or his or her designee, may grant the permit.



 



   (b)   If the recommendation of the Department is to grant a Police
Permit with conditions over which the applicant disagrees, the permit
application and a report prepared by the Department shall be forwarded to the
Executive Director or his/her designee for review.  If the Executive
Director or designee concurs with the Department's recommendation, the

   (c)   If the recommendation of the Department is to deny the permit
application, the permit application and Department report setting forth the

concurs with the Department's recommendation, the application and Department
report shall be forwarded to the Police Permit Review Panel for action.  If

recommendation, he or she may grant the permit.



 



 



SEC. 103.30.  EFFECT OF GRANTING PERMIT.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 176,907, Eff. 9/25/05.)



 



   The granting of a permit by the Board is not to be considered as
approving or condoning any act, conduct or condition of the
applicant/permittee committed or existing prior to the grant of the permit.



 



   The granting of a permit by the Board does not:



 



   (a)   Relieve the applicant/permittee from obtaining all appropriate
permits or approvals required by the City of Los Angeles, or state or federal
law;



 



   (b)   Relieve an applicant/permittee from compliance with all
applicable local, state, and federal laws, including those related to
building, zoning, fire, and other public safety regulations;



 



   (c)   Vest any development rights in the property or business; or



 



   (d)   Relieve the permittee from complying with conditions  imposed
upon the operation of a business pursuant to a discretionary land use permit
or a nuisance abatement proceeding.  In case of a conflict, the more
restrictive conditions shall control.



 



 



SEC. 103.31.  DENIAL OF APPLICATION.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 179,836, Eff. 6/7/08.)



 



   If the Board determines that the application does not satisfy the
requirements of this article, it shall deny the application.  The Board may
also deny a permit on any of the following grounds:



 



   (a)   Grounds for Denial of Application Issued Subject to this
Article.  (Except Sections 103.101.1, 103.102, or 103.109.)



 



   1.   The applicant made a false or misleading statement of a
material fact or omission of a material fact in the application;



 



   2.   The applicant is under eighteen years of age;



 



   3.   The applicant has committed or aided or abetted in the
commission of any act or omission, which, if committed by a permittee, would
be a ground for suspension, revocation, or other disciplinary action under
this article;



 



   4.   The applicant has had a similar type of permit previously
denied, suspended or revoked within five years immediately preceding the date
of the filing of the application, and the applicant can show no material
change in circumstances since the denial, suspension or revocation;



 



   5.   The business for which the permit is sought is prohibited by
any local or state law, statute, rule or regulation, or prohibited in the
particular location by the provisions of Chapter I of this Code;



 



   6.   The business for which the permit is sought has been or is a

(Title and Section Amended by Ord. No. 177,412, Eff. 5/1/06.)




 



   (a)   Permit Required.  No person shall operate, maintain, manage
or conduct a picture arcade or an adult picture arcade without a written
permit from the Board.



 



   No permit shall be required under this section if the person engaged in
the operation of the arcade has a valid carnival permit issued under the
provisions of Division 7 of Chapter 10 of this Code in which a picture arcade
is permitted.



 



   (b)   Notwithstanding any other provision and specifically the
provisions of Sections 12.26 A.2., 102.02(d), 102.15 and 102.17, the
following provisions apply to picture arcades and adult picture arcades.



 



   (1)   Application.  An application for a picture arcade or an adult
picture arcade permit shall be filed in person only at the main office of the
Office of Finance.  The person receiving the application shall record the
date and time received on the application.  An incomplete application for a
permit under this section shall be returned within 30 days with a date stamp
of the date of return and be accompanied by a written statement specifying
the reasons for the return.  Any refiled application shall also be processed
within 30 days.  If there is no final, judicially reviewable decision within
30 days, the permit shall be deemed granted except that any period during
which a hearing or a decision on a hearing is pending shall not count toward
the 30 days.



 



   (2)   Building and Safety Verification.  An application for a
picture arcade or adult picture arcade shall include proof that a request was
filed with the Department of Building and Safety for verification that the
proposed use is permitted: 1) in the zone where the site is located and 2) by
the certificate of occupancy.  The request for verification shall be filed
at the Zoning Counter located at the downtown office of the Department of
Building and Safety.  Any response to the request for verification shall be
included with the application.  A permit for a picture arcade or adult
picture arcade shall not be denied based upon the applicant's failure to
obtain verification if the Department of Building and Safety has not
responded to the request within the 30 day permit application processing
period.



 



   (3)   Denial of Application.  Prior to denial of the permit, the
applicant shall be given written notice of the intention to deny the
permit.  The Board may deny the permit upon any of the grounds expressly set
forth in 103.31(b), or any other zoning-related grounds.  A request for
hearing on the intention to deny may be filed pursuant to Section 103.33. 
The hearing may be continued for up to 30 days by the applicant.  Any denial
of the permit shall set forth all bases for denying the permit.  Additional
bases may not be added to the denial following remand by a court or upon
reconsideration.  Any decision denying the permit shall be a final decision.



 



   (4)   Suspension or Revocation for violation of Section 103.34.1
4.  The Police Department shall provide written notice to the on-premises
manager or permittee of conduct that violates Section 103.34.1 4.  Notice
may be given pursuant to Section 102.02(f).  A suspension or revocation
order may not be based upon 103.34.1 4, unless the Board makes an affirmative
finding of actual knowledge that the conduct regularly occurred on the
premises and that the permittee thereafter failed to take steps to prevent
the conduct.



 



   (5)   Suspension or Revocation based on Orders of Other Agencies or
City Departments.  Orders or determinations received from other agencies or
City departments may be grounds for suspension or revocation only if they are
final and in writing.



 



   (6)   Service of Order of Revocation or Suspension.  An order
revoking or suspending a permit for a picture arcade or an adult picture
arcade shall be served by certified mail and shall be final upon service upon
the permittee.  The order shall not be enforced for a period of 35 days
after the service.



 



   (7)   Reconsideration of Board Decision of Suspension or
Revocation.  The permittee may request reconsideration of the Board decision
of suspension or revocation within ten days of service of the order in
accordance with Section 103.33.  If reconsideration is requested,
enforcement of the decision shall be further deferred 35 days from the date
of service of the Board's decision, service of which shall also be by
certified mail.

five days before the date of the requested Event.  The five-day time
limitation shall be waived by the Designated Police Commissioner if the
occurrence giving rise to the permit application did not reasonably allow the
applicant time to file within the time prescribed, and imposition of the time
limitation would place an unreasonable restriction on the right to free
speech.

applicant to apply for such permit on its behalf.

   Immediately upon the granting of a permit, the Board shall transmit a

   3.   Action on Application.



 



   A.   Recommendations of Department.



 



   (1)   If the recommendation of the Department is to approve the
application without conditions or with conditions to which the applicant
agrees, the Executive Director of the Board, on behalf of the Board, shall
approve the permit.



 



   (2)   If the recommendation of the Department is to approve the

recommendations shall be referred to the Designated Police Commissioner and a

Police Commissioner shall act to grant or deny the application in compliance
with Subdivision (f)(1).  The applicant shall be notified in writing of the

courier and shall be informed that the applicant has the right to appeal the
decision as set forth in Subsection (j) below.



 



   (g)   Issuance of the Permit.  The Board shall issue a permit
following:



 



   1.   Final action on the permit pursuant to Subsection (f);



 



   2.   An agreement by the applicant or sponsor in writing to comply
with any conditions imposed on the Event by the permit, including payment of

   3.   Compliance with all of the applicable requirements of
Subsection (h) below.



 



   (h)   Conditions to Issuance of Permit.  The Board may condition
the issuance of a permit by imposing reasonable requirements concerning the
time, place, and manner of the Event, as necessary to protect the safety of
all persons and property, provided that the conditions shall not unreasonably
restrict the right of free speech.  These conditions include, but are not
limited to:



 



   1.   Alteration of the date or time of the Event proposed on the
application;



 



   2.   Alteration of the location of the Assembly, route of the
Parade, and/or the area and manner of assembling and disbanding of the Parade;



 



   3.   Accommodation of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, including
restricting the Event to only a portion of a street or highway;



 



   4.   Compliance with all ordinances or laws and obtaining all
legally required permits or licenses;



 



   5.   Requirements for the training and use of volunteers, monitors,
or parade officials;



 



   6.   Restrictions on the number and type of vehicles, animals, or
structures at the Event, and prior inspection and approval of floats,
structures, and decorated vehicles for fire safety by the Los Angeles Fire
Department;



 



   7.   Requirements for the use of garbage containers, cleanup, and

officials or volunteers to ensure a safe and expeditious parade;



 



   10.   Requirements for the provision of adequate first aid and

   11.   Requirements for the use of amplification devices or amplified

upon the streets or highways).



 



   (i)   Grounds for Denial of Application or Revocation of a Permit.



 



   1.   The Board, through either the Executive Director or the
Designated Police Commissioner, shall approve an application for a permit
unless it determines from a consideration of the application or other
pertinent information, the existence of any of the following, any of which
shall also be justification for the Board to revoke a previously issued
permit:



 



   A.   Information contained in the application, or supplementary
information requested from the applicant, is false in any material detail;



 



   B.   The applicant failed to provide a complete application after
being notified of the requirement of producing additional information or
documents;



 



   C.   The Event will interfere with another Event, street closure or
other activity for which a permit has previously been granted;



 



   D.   The concentration of persons, animals and/or vehicles at the
site of the Event, or at the assembly and disbanding areas, will prevent
proper police, fire, ambulance, or other public services to areas contiguous
to the Event;



 



   E.   The time, route or size of the Event will disrupt to an
unreasonable extent the safe and expeditious movement of traffic contiguous
to the event site or route, or unreasonably disrupt the use of a street or
highway when it is usually subject to great traffic congestion;



 



   F.   The size or duration of the Event will require the diversion of
so great a number of police officers of the City that providing the minimum
level of police services to other areas of the City is jeopardized.  Nothing
in this paragraph authorizes denial of a permit because of the need to
protect Event participants from the conduct of others;



 



   G.   The Event will substantially interfere with any construction or
maintenance work scheduled to take place upon or along the affected City
streets or highways, or a previously granted encroachment permit;



 



   H.   The parade will not move from its point of origin to its point
of termination in five hours or less;



 



   I.   The length of the parade route exceeds 3 miles from its point
of origin to its point of termination; or



 



   J.   The applicant fails to conduct the Event in accordance with the
information contained in the permit application, or any terms and conditions
imposed on the issued permit.



 



   2.   When the grounds for denial of the application for a permit
specified in Subdivision (i)1. can be corrected by altering the time, place
and/or manner of the Event as authorized by Subsection (h), the Board shall,
instead of denying the application, conditionally approve the application
provided the applicant accepts such conditions for permit issuance.  The
conditions imposed shall provide for only such modifications of the
applicant's proposed Event as are necessary to achieve compliance with this
subsection.



 



   (j)   Appeal Procedure.



 



   1.   Right to Appeal.  The applicant shall have the right to appeal
any permit conditions imposed upon an Event or the denial of a permit
application.  The applicant shall also have the right to appeal the amount
of traffic control fees or clean-up deposits imposed pursuant to subsection
(l).



 



   2.   Notice of Appeal.  A notice of appeal stating the grounds for
the appeal shall be filed with the Board no later than three days after
delivery of the notice of the denial of the application or notice of the
contested/disputed permit conditions.



 



   3.   Hearing by the Board.



 



   A.   If an applicant files a notice of appeal, the Board shall
conduct a hearing on the appeal at the next scheduled meeting of the Board. 
The Board shall render its decision at the hearing unless the permit
applicant or sponsor agrees to a continuance.  The decision of the Board is
final.



 



   B.   If the date of the next scheduled meeting of the Board
following the receipt of a notice of appeal is later than two business days
before the date of the scheduled Event, the Board shall convene a special
meeting within 24 hours of the delivery of the notice of appeal.  Notice of
the time and place of said special meeting shall be given to all parties at
least 24 hours prior to said hearing.  The Board shall render its decision
at the hearing unless the permit applicant or sponsor agrees to a
continuance.  The decision of the Board is final.



 



   C.   No Board member who did not hear the evidence or who was not
read or heard the record or proceedings shall vote on the decision.



 



   (k)   Contents of Permit.  In each permit, the Board shall
prescribe:



 



   1.   The assembly area and time therefor:



 



   2.   The start time;



 



   3.   The minimum and maximum speeds for the Parade;



 



   4.   The exact route of the Parade;



 



   5.   What portions of streets to be traversed may be occupied by the
Event;



 



   6.   The maximum number of units and the maximum and minimum
interval of space to be maintained between the units of the Parade;



 



   7.   The maximum length of the Parade in miles or fractions thereof;



 



   8.   The disbanding area and disbanding time;



 



   9.   The number of persons required to officiate and/or monitor the
Event;



 



   10.   The number and type of vehicles, if any;



 



   11.   The material and maximum size of any sign, banner, placard or
carrying device therefor; and



 



   12.   All conditions imposed upon the Event pursuant to Subsection
(h) of this Section.



 



    (l)   Fees and Indemnification.



 



   1.   Each applicant, and any other person, organization, firm or
corporation on whose behalf the application is made, shall be required to
agree in writing to jointly and separately indemnify, protect and defend and
hold harmless the City of Los Angeles, its officers and employees against all
claims, damages, expenses, loss or liability of any kind or nature whatsoever
arising out of, or resulting from, the alleged acts or omissions of the
permittee, its officers, agents or employees in connection with the Parade or
Assembly.



 



   2.   Traffic Control Costs.



 



   A.   Prepayment of Costs.  Upon approval by the Board of a permit
for a Parade or Assembly but prior to the date of the scheduled Event, the
Department of Transportation, through the Bureau of Street Services, shall
provide the applicant with a statement of the estimated cost of providing
traffic management at the Event.  The applicant/sponsor shall be required to
pay the traffic control costs either prior to the date of the Event or within
15 days thereafter.  Traffic control consists of clearing the
parade/assembly route of unauthorized vehicles, posting any parking
restrictions necessary for the Event, diverting traffic around the Event, and
directing pedestrian and vehicular traffic along the route of a parade.



 



   B.   Computing Traffic Control Costs.  The traffic control costs
shall be computed by determining the number of LADOT personnel who will be
required for traffic control beyond that which would otherwise be required at
that time, multiplied by the number of hours for which such additional
service is rendered at the rate of the City's full cost of providing officers
on an hourly basis as established by the Department of Transportation.



 



   C.   Refunds or Additional Charges.  If the actual cost for traffic
control on the date of the Event is less than the estimated cost pursuant to
Subdivision (l)2.A. above, the applicant/ sponsor will be refunded the
difference by the City.  If more traffic officers' hours are required than
originally charged, the applicant/sponsor will be billed the additional costs.



 



   D.   Traffic control costs shall not be assessed if the size of the
parade/assembly can be controlled by 5 or fewer traffic officers over a
two-hour period, as determined by LADOT.

satisfied:



 



   1.   The dance or dancing activity for which an application has been
filed conforms to the laws of the City of Los Angeles and of the State of
California, and will not constitute a menace to the health, peace or safety
of the community;



 



   2.   A sufficient number of adult supervisors who are employees of
the location will be provided to insure compliance with the provisions of
this section and any rules or regulations promulgated by the Board with

at a minimum, a ratio of one adult to every 35 teenagers in attendance at the
teenage dance premises.



 



   (f)   Lighting in Hall.  Each of the premises where any dance or

public school holidays. On all other days, except Fridays, Saturdays, and the
day before a legal holiday, teenage dancing regulated hereunder shall be
prohibited after the hour of 10:00 p.m., provided however that permission to
continue dancing after 10:00 p.m. on such other days may be granted by the
Board during public school vacation periods if the Board finds the
continuation of dancing after 10:00 p.m. does not unreasonably disturb the
peace and quiet of the surrounding neighborhood. In no event shall such an
establishment be permitted to continue such teenage dances or dancing
activity later than 1:00 a.m.



 



   (j)   Teenagers Under the Age of 15 Years.  No person under the age
of 15 years shall be permitted to enter any premises where there is dancing
activity regulated under this section unless such person is accompanied by a
parent or legal guardian unless the parent or legal guardian of such person
has signed and filed with the owner, manager or operator of the facility a
consent form for such minor to be there unaccompanied by said parent or
guardian. The consent shall be set forth on a form approved by the Board.
Such form must be signed by the parent or legal guardian in the presence of
the owner, manager or operator of the facility and shall contain the
minor’s name, date of birth, address, and the parent or legal guardian’s
telephone number for use in case of an emergency. In the event no such
consent form has been so completed and filed, such teenagers shall not be
permitted to enter into or remain at the premises unless accompanied or
escorted by his or her parent or legal guardian. Any teenager admitted and
accompanied by a parent or legal guardian shall have the rights and
privileges of other legally admitted teenagers. Any teenager entering
pursuant to a consent form filed by his or her parent or legal guardian must
present valid identification as defined in Subsection (n).



 



   (k)   Persons Under the Age of 13 Years.  In no event shall any

section.



 



   (l)   Persons Over the Age of 20 Years.  No person over the age of

Subsections (j) and (m) herein.



 



   (m)   Teenagers Between the Age of 15 and 18 Years.  No person
between the ages of 15 and 18 years may be present at premises regulated
under this section unless he or she (1) is accompanied by a parent or legal
guardian, or, if unaccompanied, the parent or legal guardian of such person
has signed and filed a consent form similar to that required by Subsection
(j) herein; or (2) presents valid proof of age as defined in Subsection (n)
herein.



 



   (n)   Proof of Age.  Proof of age shall be required of each patron
entering the establishment. Such proof may be established by identification
issued by a governmental agency, the patron’s school, or the Department of
Motor Vehicles, and must contain the patron’s name, date of birth, and a
picture that has been taken within the preceding two years.



 



   (o)   Denial of Entry on Request of Parent.  No person having
charge or control of any premises regulated under this section shall allow a
teenager to enter or remain at the premises after receiving a written notice
signed by the parent or legal guardian of such teenager which requests that
said teenager be prevented from entering the premises.



 



   (p)   Attendance.  Except in emergency situations, no patron shall
be permitted to leave the premises at which any dance or dancing activity
regulated by this section is being held and thereafter re-enter prior to the
conclusion of such dance or dancing activity. No pass or other indicia
permitting re-entry shall be issued.



 



   (q)   Criminal History of Supervisory Staff.  No person, dancing
club, or other association or entity obtaining a permit under this section
shall employ any person as a supervisory employee at the premises at the time
of any dancing activity regulated hereunder who has been convicted of a
misdemeanor or a felony in the last five (5) years, nor shall such permittee
employ any person who has been arrested and is out on bail or on his or her
own recognizance pending trial. As permitted by California Labor Code Section
432.7, such permittee shall ask all applicants for such employment at the
premises about any conviction, as that term is used in said Labor Code
Section, and about any arrest for which the applicant is out on bail or on
his or her own recognizance pending trial. Copies of the employment
applications of all persons hired shall be filed with the Board. Upon a
showing of just causes a permittee may apply to the Board for a waiver of
this provision. Just cause, as used in this subsection, shall include but is
not limited to a demonstration that the prior conviction, or arrest as
described herein, would not have an adverse effect on the employee’s
ability to supervise teenagers at a location as described within this
section. While teenagers are present, all employees also present within the
premises, as that term is defined by this section, shall be considered
supervisory employees.



 



   (r)   Duty of Management.  If a teenager is discovered inside the
premises showing evidence or symptoms of being intoxicated as a result of the
ingestion of alcohol or any chemical substance, that teenager shall be
reported by management to local police authorities and to his or her parent
or legal guardian. Management shall attempt to separate the teenager from
other teenagers at the premises pending the arrival of police or the parent
or legal guardian of the teenager. A notice shall be posted by all pay phones
containing the local police telephone number and shall request all patrons to
call the police if management neglects to take action to report a violation
of this subsection.



 



   (s)   Operation After 1:00 a.m. – 18 Year Olds.  If the premises
intends to operate after the closing time set forth in Subsection (i) herein,
the premises must first be vacated by all customers, and thereafter only
those persons 18 years of age or older who present valid identification
containing proof of age established as set forth in Subsection (n) herein may
be permitted to enter the premises.



 



   (t)   Additional Restrictions by the Board.  The Board may
promulgate additional rules as necessary with respect thereto.



 



   (u)   Regulation by Permittee.  Nothing herein is intended to
preclude the imposition of more restrictive regulations by any permittee so
long as the regulations are not in conflict with any provision of this
section.



 



 



SEC. 103.120.  SOUNDPROOFING OF PLACES OF AMUSEMENT – WHEN REQUIRED.



 



   (a)   Places of Amusement Included.  This section applies to any
place of public amusement or recreation for the operation of which a permit
from the Board of Police Commissioners is required by this Code and in
connection with which any loudspeaking system or public address system is
used, or any other method of amplifying music, speech or sound employed.



 



   (b)   Authority of the Board.  Whenever, upon notice and hearing,
as required by this chapter, the Board shall determine that music or noise
from any such place of amusement or recreation, caused by the operation of
any loudspeaking system, public address system or other method of amplifying
music, speech or sound, interferes with the peace and quiet of a substantial
number of persons dwelling in the vicinity as to deprive them of the
reasonable enjoyment of their property, the Board may suspend the permit
until the offending premises is sound-proofed in a manner that, in the
judgment of the Board, will be effective to eliminate the annoyance
complained of.

SEC. 103.202.  AUTOMOBILE PARKING LOTS.



 



   (a)   Definitions.  As used in this article:



 



   1.   “AUTOMOBILE PARKING LOT” or “LOT” means any lot,
contiguous lots, or other parcels of land under single management or control
where more than eight motor vehicles are kept stored or parked within or
without a building, for a consideration, at any one time.



 



   EXEMPTIONS:



 



   The provisions of this section shall not apply to any automobile
parking lot:



 



   (i)   Which is operated and entirely controlled by the owner or
operator of an apartment house, lodging house, hotel or multiple dwelling,
motel, auto court, or other place of residence, or any office building, when
such lot is used exclusively, with no fee or charge, for the accommodation of
the vehicles of occupants, tenants or lessees of that place of residence or
office building and their guests and invitees;



 



   (ii)   Which is not operated for profit but is maintained and used
exclusively for the accommodation of the vehicles of employees or customers
of the owner or person in control of the lot; or



 



   (iii)   Which is directly operated and maintained by the owner or
operator of any retail or wholesale store or any theatre or other business or
amusement establishment, and is used exclusively for the accommodation of
vehicles of the customers or patrons thereof, with no fee or charge being
made therefor.



 



   (b)   Permit Required.  (Amended by Ord. No. 180,922, Eff.
12/12/09.)



 



   1.   No person shall conduct, manage or operate an automobile
parking lot without a written permit from the Board.  For purposes of this
section, lots or parcels of land separated by a public street or public alley
shall not be deemed contiguous lots or parcels.



 



   2.   Companies that conduct, manage, or operate multiple automobile
parking lots shall obtain a Master Automobile Parking Lot permit.  The
Master Automobile Parking Lot permit application shall comply with the
requirements set forth in Section 103.02.1 and shall separately identify each
parking lot to which it applies.  A Master Automobile Parking Lot permit
shall apply only to those parking lots specifically identified in the permit
at the time it is issued.



 



   3.   Companies that have obtained a Master Automobile Parking Lot
permit shall file any applications for additional automobile parking lots in
person only at the main office of the Office of Finance.  Such applications
for additional lots shall provide the location of the additional lot and the
name of a qualified manager designated to conduct, manage or operate the
additional lot.



 



   4.   The Board may grant a temporary permit for an additional
parking lot on the same day the application for such parking lot is submitted
to the Office of Finance provided the following conditions are met:



 



   (i)   A Master Automobile Parking Lot permit is on file at the
Office of Finance;



 



   (ii)   A complete application for the additional parking lot is on
file at the Office of Finance;



 



   (iii)   All permit fees and taxes owed to the City have been paid to
the Office of Finance;



 



   (iv)   Documentation of the proper zoning clearance has been
submitted to the Office of Finance; and



 



   (v)   A preliminary investigation by the Board does not reveal
information which would normally constitute grounds for denial.



 



   (c)   Prerequisite to Application.



 



   1.   Bond Required.  Before an application for a permit to operate
a parking lot will be received or acted upon, the applicant must file and
maintain with the Office of Finance (Amended by Ord. No. 173,300, Eff.
6/30/00, Oper. 7/1/00.) a bond in the amount of $10,000 for each parking lot,
or a blanket bond in the amount of $50,000 covering all parking lots owned or
operated by the same applicant. Such bond shall indemnify any person whose
vehicle is accepted by the permittee for parking or storage against loss by
reason of theft or other unlawful taking, or for damages to such vehicle for
which the permittee is legally liable. Said bond shall provide that it will
be continuous until cancelled by a 30 day written notice, and that it will
cover each and every annual permit issued to the principal named until so
cancelled. Notice of cancellation shall be sent by registered mail to the
City Attorney 30 days in advance of the cancellation date.



 



   All bonds shall be executed by a corporate surety approved by the Board
and admitted to do business in this State. Such bond shall not be void upon
the first recovery, but may be sued and recovered upon from time to time by
any person aggrieved, until the whole amount is exhausted.



 



   2.   Liability Under Bond – Restoration.  If the amount of
liability under the bond is decreased for any reason, the permit shall be
automatically suspended. In order to reinstate the permit, the permittee
shall either file a new bond or restore the bond on file to the original
amount.



 



   (d)   Disciplinary Action – Additional Ground.  The following
acts committed by a permittee hereunder shall be a ground for disciplinary
action in addition to the grounds listed in Sec. 103.35:



 



   1.   The permittee, his agents or employees, through carelessness,
negligence or failure to make proper provision for the safeguarding of
vehicles left in their custody, have knowingly or unknowingly facilitated or
contributed toward the theft or conversion of any such vehicle; or of the
contents thereof, or the damaging of any such vehicle; or



 



   2.   The permittee, his agents or employees have failed to cooperate
with the police to aid in the detection of any theft or other crime committed
on the premises described in the permit or which arose out of the conduct of
the business for which the permit was issued; or



 



   3.   The permittee, his agents or employees delivered a vehicle in
their custody to a person who failed to present either the parking ticket
issued therefor or a memorandum written and signed in the presence of said
permittee or his attendant by the person to whom the ticket was delivered.
Such memorandum must give a satisfactory reason for the inability to produce
the ticket. No penalty for a violation of this subdivision shall be imposed
against any permittee or attendant where the vehicle was delivered to the
registered owner thereof or to any person lawfully entitled to possession of
the vehicle.



 



   (e)   Handling of Vehicles.



 



   (1)   Neither the permittee, his agents or employees shall drive,
park, stand, stop or store any vehicle parked or stored in any such parking
lot on, upon or across any public street, public sidewalk, public alley or
other public place, or drive or move any vehicle parked or stored in any
automobile parking lot, except within the property lines of such automobile
parking lot. Neither the permittee nor any agent or employee shall take or
drive, or permit any person to take or drive, any vehicle left in the custody
of the permittee away from such automobile parking lot for any purpose
without the express permission of the bailor of such vehicle or his
authorized representative, except that any such vehicle may be moved for
safekeeping to another place in the event of fire, flood or other catastrophe
or emergency.



 



   (2)   The permittee, his agents or employees shall notify the Police
Department whenever a vehicle has been left on a parking lot for a period in
excess of 48 hours without a prior contractual arrangement for such period of
time in order to determine whether the vehicle is stolen or abandoned.
Following such notification, the permittee, his agents or employees may
remove or cause to be removed such vehicle to a facility within the City that
is attended on a 24-hour basis, for the purpose of protecting the property
for the account of and at the expense of the bailor of the vehicle.



 



   (f)   Guarding of Vehicles.



 



   (1)   Attendants – Receipts.  There must be at least one
attendant on the lot at all times during the hours the lot is open for
business. At each closing time, each vehicle, except those locked by the
persons bringing them to the lot, which then remains on the lot, shall be
securely locked if a key thereto is available and said key deposited with a
responsible person at a safe and convenient place, both previously approved
by the Board, to be delivered to the person who parked the vehicle upon
surrender of the parking receipt or ticket. A ticket or receipt must be
delivered to each person leaving a vehicle on the lot at the time of such
leaving, and must have printed on it the name of the person maintaining or
operating such lot and the address thereof, and also the place where the key
to the vehicle may be obtained after the lot has closed; except that a
parking receipt or ticket need not be delivered at time of parking to
contract or term customers of parking lots; in lieu of such ticket or receipt
for contract or term customers, the parking lot shall issue a receipt to the
customer at the beginning of each contract or term period for parking.



 



   (2)   Return of Vehicles.  The permittee, his agents, or employees
shall deliver each vehicle to the person who left that vehicle in his care
upon presentation of the parking ticket or receipt therefor.



 



   (3)   Lots Without Attendants – Regulations.  (Amended by Ord.
No. 133,317, Eff. 12/23/66.)  The Board may permit the operation of a
parking lot without an attendant where the customer is required to drive,
park and lock his vehicle if the Board finds that the design of the lot makes
such operation feasible without causing traffic congestion or damage to
property. In no event shall a permittee be allowed to operate a parking lot
without an attendant where the vehicles are so parked that any vehicle has to
be moved in order to move any other vehicle.



 



   Each parking lot operated without an attendant which is equipped with
an automatic device, whether coin operated or otherwise, which regulates
ingress or egress or both ingress and egress, shall have posted on or about
all such devices a sign, plainly visible to the public indicating the name,
address and telephone number of a person to be contacted in case of emergency
or failure of the automatic device to function. The person to be notified
shall respond to any request for assistance within a reasonable time.



 



   Each parking lot operated without an attendant shall have a workable
device to inform the public when the lot is fully occupied, except that where
parking is restricted to use of contract customers on a daily, weekly or
monthly rental basis, a sign shall be posted informing the public of the
parking restrictions applicable.



 



   If the Board finds that the parking lot is so designed that the public
can readily determine if parking spaces are open without driving onto the
lot, it may exempt the lot from the requirement of an automatic device to
indicate that the lot is full.



 



   (g)   Signs – Closing Time – Parking Fees.



 



   (1)   Each permittee shall install and maintain at each entrance of
the lot for which the permit has been issued a sign plainly visible from the
street with letters and numerals at least six inches high and one-inch stroke
in contrasting colors, showing the permittee’s name, the address of the
business, the time the lot closes, and the parking fees; except, however,
that the name and address of the permittee need not exceed three inches in
height with a one-half inch stroke, in contrasting colors. If any letters or
numerals on such signs exceed 12 inches in height, then all other numerals
and letters relating to parking fees shall be not less than one-half the
height of the largest numeral or letter on the sign. All fractions of time
shall be spelled out in letters. Parking fees shall be posted at the entrance
of the lot as follows:



 



   (i)   Rates per hour;



 



   (ii)   Rates per fraction of an hour, if any;



 



   (iii)   Rates for subsequent hours or fraction thereof;



 



   (iv)   The maximum charge;



 



   (v)   The time the lot closes.



 



   In the event that afternoon, evening, or night parking fees will be
higher than the daytime fees, then such higher fees shall also be posted at
the entrance of the parking lot in addition to the daytime parking fees.



 



   Each permittee shall install and maintain in a conspicuous place on the
parking lot, which place may be designated by the Board, a sign with letters
and numerals at least six inches high and one-inch stroke in contrasting
colors showing a complete schedule of parking fees applicable during any
business day showing all rates, changes in rates and the hours such changes
become effective. If any letters or numerals on such signs exceed 12 inches
in height, then all other numerals and letters relating to parking fees shall
be not less than one-half the height of the largest letter or numeral on the
sign. All fractions of time shall be spelled out in letters.



 



   It shall be unlawful for any permittee or his agents or employees to
charge or collect any parking fees for the parking of any vehicle at a rate
in excess of the rate posted at the entrance of the lot at the time the
vehicle was accepted for storage, nor shall any permittee alter or change any
of his posted schedules of fees by superimposing another and different sign
thereon, or otherwise, during the course of any business day while the lot is
open for business; provided, however, that any posted schedule of fees may be
changed prior to the opening of any lot for business at the beginning of any
business day, and the fee schedule posted at the entrance of the lot may be
changed at the time of change to a night rate and to a second night rate
change after 1:00 o’clock A.M.



 



   (2)   Each permittee shall file with the Board and post on the
parking lot within 30 days after the effective date of this subdivision a
complete and accurate schedule of rates to be charged specifying therein the
time and the dates for which such rates are applicable. Applicants for
parking lot permits shall file such a schedule with their application and
post such schedule on the lot before operating the parking lot. No charge
other than the rates specified in such schedule shall be made except as
hereinafter provided.



 



   In the event a permittee desires to change his schedule of rates he
shall give a 10-day written notice to the Board which shall contain the new
schedule of rates. A duplicate copy of such notice shall be posted for a
period of 10 days in a conspicuous place in the parking lot, which place may
be designated by the Board. Upon the expiration of the 10-day period, the
rates may be changed in accordance with such notice.



 



   Upon the application to the Board and a showing of hardship by the
permittee, the Board may permit a downward revision of the rate schedule
within the said 10-day period.  (Amended by Ord. No. 113,316, Eff. 5/29/59.)



 



   (3)   When an automobile parking lot has been filled to the safe
capacity stated upon the permit for that lot, the operator shall not allow

reasonable period of time, without movement of other vehicles into the public

6/20/11.)  An alarm system user who fails to obtain an original permit as
required by this Section shall pay a Late Permit Penalty of $15.00 in

paid in full, without other notification to the person billed.



 



   (j)    If the Office of Finance determines that any amount due
pursuant to this section cannot be collected or that efforts to collect this
sum would be disproportionately costly in relation to the probable outcome of
the collecting efforts relative to the amount due, the Office of Finance may
prepare a report setting forth the findings and reason for that determination
and submit that report to a Board of Review constituted under Section 11.04
of this Code and authorized to act as provided in that section.  Upon
unanimous approval of the finding by the Board of Review, the Office of
Finance may remove any unpaid sum owing or believed to be owing from the
active accounts receivable of the Department.  The removal however shall not
preclude the City from collecting or attempting to collect the sum if it
later proves to be collectible, as provided by Section 11.04.  In the event

has consented to an inspection by a police officer of all goods under such

scheduled date of the show or event. Upon application by the promoter and the
exhibitor, the Board may approve the participation of an exhibitor who has
not filed an application 14 days prior to the scheduled date of the show or

MUCH MORE LIKELY TO BE USED TO KILL OR INJURE A HOUSEHOLD MEMBER THAN TO
PROTECT AGAINST AN ATTACKER.  IT IS SAFEST NOT TO KEEP A GUN IN THE HOME.

AND AMMUNITION SHOULD BE LOCKED SEPARATELY.

purchase of the firearm(s), which includes the warning language required in

permittee) stating under penalty of perjury that within the first five
business days of that April or October, as the case may be, the signer
personally confirmed the presence of the firearms and all other information
reported on the inventory.



 



   (s)   Revocation of Permit.  (Subsec. (r) Redesignated as (s) by
Ord. No. 180,451, Eff. 2/7/09.)  In addition to any other grounds for
revocation of a permit, such permit shall be revoked if permittee’s Federal
firearms license is revoked or expires.



 



   (t)   (Subsec. (s) Redesignated as (t) by Ord. No. 180,451, Eff.

SEC. 104.00.  PURPOSE.



   (Added by Ord. No. 185,343, Eff. 12/19/17.)



 



   In November 2016, the people of the State of California voted to
approve Proposition 64, the Adult Use of Marijuana Act (AUMA), which
decriminalized certain activities related to non-medical cannabis in
California. Subsequently, the State enacted the Medicinal and Adult-Use
Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act to establish a system to control and
regulate the cultivation, distribution, transport, storage, manufacturing,
processing and sale of both medicinal and recreational cannabis. The AUMA
also provided for State licensing of commercial cannabis businesses, starting
January 1, 2018. State law requires city approval in order to obtain a State
License. The City desires to create a licensing system for certain
cannabis-related businesses. Therefore, the City has created a Department of
Cannabis Regulations and a Cannabis Regulation Commission to implement this
article and otherwise coordinate administration of the requirements of this
article. The City Council will promulgate and approve by resolution Rules and
Regulations for this article.



 



   The City has a long history of working with communities to make medical
cannabis available to patients with a medical need and physician approval.
However, the City experienced years of litigation enforcing various
ordinances against illegal cannabis businesses.



 



   Because the ongoing litigation limited enforcement, it left residents
subject to the negative impacts and secondary effects associated with
Cannabis related activities in the City, including, but not limited to, those
documented in case law and in the legislative histories of Cannabis-related
laws in the City. Without comprehensive regulations, consumers in the City
were vulnerable to the dangers inherent in ingesting and using a substance
that was not subject to basic rules of safety for ingestible substances. Nor
were the businesses penalized for unscrupulous practices utilized against
defenseless consumers. Further, unregulated cannabis businesses remain a
source of danger for unsuspecting neighbors when fires or other catastrophes
take place at those locations.



 



   In order to appropriately acknowledge and address the harmful impacts
of past Cannabis policies and their enforcement, the Social Equity Program is
aimed at promoting equitable ownership and employment opportunities in the
Cannabis industry. This program is intended to decrease disparities in life
outcomes for marginalized communities and to address disproportionate impacts
of Cannabis prohibition in adversely-impacted and lower income communities.
In furtherance of these goals, the City Council adopts the Social Equity
Analysis report, dated October 18, 2017, and its addendums, as the findings
for the Social Equity Program.



 



   Therefore, it is the City's intent to issue licenses in an orderly and
transparent manner to eligible applicants according to the requirements of
this article and the Rules and Regulations, and to mitigate the negative
impacts brought by unregulated Cannabis businesses.

SEC. 104.07.  PROPOSITION M PRIORITY PROCESSING.



   (Added by Ord. No. 185,343, Eff. 12/19/17.)



 



   (a)   Proposition M Priority Processing Applications for Retailer
Commercial Cannabis Activity, which includes delivery, and on-site
cultivation consistent with Proposition D, shall be accepted and processed by
DCR for the first 60 days after DCR starts accepting applications.  EMMD
Applicants may apply for a maximum of one Microbusiness License (Type 12); or
a maximum combination of one Retailer License (Type 10), one Distributor
License (Type 11), one Manufacturer License (Type 6 only) and one
Cultivation, Indoor (Type 1A, 1C, 2A or 3A) License for the one location
identified in its original or amended BTRC and as demonstrated in previous
Commercial Cannabis Activity as of March 7, 2017.  (Amended by Ord. No.
185,608, Eff. 7/23/18.)



 



   (b)   An EMMD that as of January 1, 2018, meets all of Proposition D
requirements shall continue to have limited immunity up until the time the
EMMD receives Temporary Approval. The limited immunity shall terminate if the
EMMD Applicant fails to seek or obtain a Temporary Approval, although the
limited immunity shall be extended through any appeal of the Temporary
Approval denial. The limited immunity shall be as follows: the EMMD shall not
be subject to the remedies set forth in Los Angeles Municipal Code Sections
11.00 or 12.27.1 solely on the basis of engaging in medical Commercial
Cannabis Activity, provided however that, as authorized by California Health
and Safety Code Section 11362.83, this limited immunity is available and may
be asserted as an affirmative defense only so long as the requirements of
this Section are adhered to by the EMMD and only by an EMMD at the one
Business Premises operated by the EMMD. This limited immunity shall not be
available to and shall not be asserted as an affirmative defense to any
violation of law except as expressly set forth in this Section. Further,
nothing contained in this limited immunity is intended to provide or shall be
asserted as a defense to a claim for violation of law brought by any county,
state or federal governmental authority.



 



   (c)   DCR's determination of whether an EMMD Applicant is eligible
for Proposition M Priority Processing shall be made with no hearing and shall
be final and effective upon the close of the 15-day appeal period if the EMMD
Applicant does not  timely request an administrative hearing, as provided in
Section 104.10.  In making its determination, DCR may request additional
information from the EMMD Applicant.  In making its determination, DCR shall
make written findings regarding whether the EMMD Applicant complies with the
requirements for priority processing for EMMDs.  In determining whether an
EMMD Applicant meets the requirements for priority processing, DCR shall
consider whether the EMMD Applicant cured any non-substantive administrative
violations in C. through F., and M. under LAMC Section 45.19.6.3.  (Amended
by Ord. No. 185,850, Eff. 11/28/18.)



 



   (d)   If Proposition M Priority Processing is denied by DCR and, if
appealed to the Commission also denied by the Commission, the EMMD Applicant
shall immediately cease all Commercial Cannabis Activity at the Business
Premises and the EMMD Applicant shall not be entitled to the limited immunity
from prosecution afforded by Proposition D. An EMMD Applicant determined
ineligible for Proposition M Priority Processing may apply for a License by
filing a new application and abiding by the application priority in effect at
that time. DCR shall not refund any fee for an application determined
ineligible for Proposition M Priority Processing.



 



   (e)   Once DCR deems a Proposition M Priority Processing Application
is complete and eligible for a Proposition M Priority Processing, DCR shall
issue the EMMD a Temporary Approval, which shall allow the EMMD to maintain
the limited immunity from prosecution afforded by Proposition D even after
Proposition D is repealed. A completed Proposition M Priority Process
Application accepted by DCR as eligible for a Proposition M Priority
Processing shall be processed and reviewed pursuant to Section 104.06. An
EMMD eligible for Proposition M Priority Processing shall not be denied a
Temporary Approval or License by the Commission based upon the EMMD's
location in a geographical area of Undue Concentration. A final denial of a
License and exhaustion of all administrative appeals shall terminate the
Temporary Approval and the limited immunity.



 



   (f)   An EMMD shall submit to a financial audit by the City's Office
of Finance and clear all City tax obligations prior to being issued a
Temporary Approval or a License.  For purposes of this subsection only, an
EMMD that has entered into a payment plan with the City's Office of Finance
pursuant to LAMC Section 21.18 to pay all outstanding City-owed business
taxes is deemed current on all City-owed business taxes and is deemed to have
submitted payment for all City-owed business taxes.  (Amended by Ord. No.
185,608, Eff. 7/23/18.)



 



   (g)   A pre-licensing inspection for a Temporary Approval is not
required for an EMMD whose Proposition M Priority Processing Application is
accepted by DCR, but shall be required before issuance of a License.



 



   (h)   An EMMD issued a License pursuant to Proposition M Priority
Processing is not required to adhere to the zone, distance and sensitive use
restrictions stated in Section 105.02 of this Code as long as, and on the
condition that, the EMMD: (1) operates and continues to operate in compliance
with the distance and sensitive use restrictions (Los Angeles Municipal Code
Section 45.19.6.3(L) and (O)) of Proposition D notwithstanding those
restrictions are or would have been repealed; and (2) limits on-site
Cultivation at the Business Premises to not exceed the size of the EMMD's
existing square footage of building space as of March 7, 2017, as documented
by dated photographs, building lease entered into on or before March 7, 2017,
or other comparable evidence.  This limited grandfathering shall not create,
confer, or convey any vested right or non-conforming right or benefit
regarding any activity conducted by the EMMD beyond the term and activities
provided by the City License.  This limited grandfathering shall cease on
December 31, 2022, after which all EMMDs shall be required to cease
conducting any commercial cannabis activities on Business Premises that do
not meet the zone requirements of Article 5 of Chapter X of this Code.  If
an EMMD issued a License fails to operate in compliance with the specified
provisions of Proposition D, the EMMD's City License shall be subject to
revocation.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,608, Eff. 7/23/18.)

2016, PROCESSING.



   (Added by Ord. No. 185,343, Eff. 12/19/17.)



 



   (a)   An Applicant who applies for a License for Non-Retailer
Commercial Cannabis Activity and who meets the below criteria as determined
by DCR shall receive a Temporary Approval, which shall provide the Applicant
with limited immunity, as described in Subsection (c), to operate pending the

qualifies under the Social Equity Program; and 12) the Applicant attests that
it will comply with all operating requirements imposed by DCR and that DCR
may immediately suspend or revoke the Temporary Approval if the Applicant
fails to abide by any City operating requirement.  For purposes of this
subsection only, an Applicant who has entered into a payment plan with the
City's Office of Finance pursuant to LAMC Section 21.18 to pay all
outstanding City-owed business taxes is deemed current on all City-owed
business taxes and is deemed to have submitted payment for all City-owed
business taxes.  Prior to determining that an Applicant is eligible for
processing under this section, DCR, at its discretion, may provide an
Applicant with local authorization to apply for a temporary license from the
Bureau of Cannabis Control, the California Department of Food and Agriculture
or the California Department of Public Health.  This local authorization
shall not permit an Applicant to engage in commercial cannabis activities
unless DCR grants the Applicant a Temporary Approval.  (Amended by Ord. No.
185,850, Eff. 11/28/18.)



 



   (b)   DCR's determination of whether an Applicant is eligible for
processing under this section shall be made with no hearing and shall be
final and effective upon the close of the 15-day appeal period if the
Applicant does not  timely request an administrative hearing, as provided in
Section 104.10.  DCR may request additional information from the
Applicant.  In making its determination, DCR shall make written findings
regarding whether the Applicant complies with the requirements for processing
under this Section.  A completed Application accepted by DCR as eligible for
a processing under this Section shall be processed and reviewed pursuant to
Section 104.06.  A final denial of a License and exhaustion of all
administrative appeals shall terminate the Temporary Approval and the limited
immunity.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,850, Eff. 11/28/18.)



 



   (c)   An Applicant that submitted an Application pursuant to this
Section by September 13, 2018, paid all fees required under Section 104.19,
and received from DCR local authorization under this section shall not be
subject to the remedies set forth in Los Angeles Municipal Code Sections
11.00 or 12.27.1 solely on the basis of Non-Retailer Commercial Cannabis
Activity; provided, however, that, as authorized by California Health and
Safety Code Section 11362.83, this limited immunity is available and may be
asserted as an affirmative defense only so long as the requirements of this
Section are adhered to by the Applicant and only by an Applicant at the one
Business Premises identified in its application.  This limited immunity
shall terminate on the date DCR makes written findings regarding whether the
Applicant meets the requirements for processing under this Section, although
the limited immunity shall be extended through any appeal of DCR's
findings.  This limited immunity shall not be available to and shall not be
asserted as an affirmative defense to any violation of law except as
expressly set forth in this Section.  Further, nothing contained in this
limited immunity is intended to provide or shall be asserted as a defense to
a claim for violation of law brought by any county, state or federal
governmental authority. (Amended by Ord. No. 185,850, Eff. 11/28/18.)



 



   (d)   Once application processing pursuant to Section 104.07 begins,
DCR may, at its discretion, accept Section 104.08 applications for a period
of 30 business days.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,608, Eff. 7/23/18.)



 



   (e)   An Applicant under this section shall not be permitted to
change the location of its Business Premises on its application after May 15,
2019.  If an Applicant did not identify a Business Premises on its
application by May 15, 2019, its application shall be deemed abandoned. 
(Added by Ord. No. 186,111, Eff. 6/14/19.)



 



   (f)   An Applicant under this section that has not received
Temporary Approval shall report to DCR by July 1, 2019, whether it has made
substantial progress, as determined by DCR, towards preparing its Business
Premises to pass a pre-license inspection.  An Applicant who cannot report
substantial progress by July 1, 2019, shall have its application deemed
abandoned.  An Applicant who reports substantial progress by July 1, 2019,
shall be required to pass a pre-license inspection by December 31, 2019, or
its application shall be deemed abandoned unless DCR grants the Applicant an
extension due to extenuating circumstances as determined by DCR in its sole
discretion.  (Added by Ord. No. 186,111, Eff. 6/14/19.)

   An Applicant seeking a Testing Lab License (Type 8) may submit an
application to DCR at any time after DCR first accepts applications for any
License.  If an Applicant obtains or attests that it has or intends to seek
ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation for all testing methods required by Title 16,
Div. 42 of the California Code of Regulations and meets all
laboratory-employee qualifications required by Title 16, Div. 42 of the
California Code of Regulations, DCR may issue a Temporary Approval to the
testing lab before completion of a pre-licensing inspection.  If an
Applicant is denied an ISO/IEC 17025 accreditation, its Temporary Approval
shall be immediately revoked and it shall immediately cease all Testing
Commercial Cannabis Activity.

written decision by DCR or the Commission (lower level decision maker).  The
appeal shall set forth the specific basis upon which the appellant claims
there was an error or abuse of discretion by the lower level decision
maker.  Any appeal not filed within the 15-day period shall be rejected as
untimely.  The lower level decision maker shall transmit to the appellate

hearing under this subsection pursuant to Section 104.05(b).  The City
Council shall hold a public hearing to consider an appeal of a Commission
decision as authorized in Section 104.06 within 15 City Council meeting days
of City Council's receipt of the appeal.  Notwithstanding the notice
requirements in Section 104.05(b), no later than 5 days prior to any City

deemed a denial of the appeal.



 



   5.   The appellate body may consider the decision and record before
the lower level decision maker and any new written information and oral
testimony timely provided to the appellate body.  The appellate body shall,
however, rule on the record and evidence de novo, substituting its own
judgment for that of the lower level decision maker without deferring to the
lower level decision maker's findings and determinations.  The appellate
body may reverse or modify, in whole or in part, any decision of the lower
level decision maker.  The appellate body shall make the same written
findings required to be made by the lower level decision maker, supported by
evidence in the record.



 



   6.   The appellate body shall issue its decision within 30 days of
the closure of the hearing on the appeal.  Failure of the appellate body to
issue its decision timely shall be deemed a denial of the appeal.

the information.



 



   (l)   If the state adopts a law requiring a state Cannabis license
applicant to agree to enter into a Labor Peace Agreement with any bona-fide
labor organization who requests such an agreement, then an Applicant for a
City Licensee shall meet that same requirement, with the exception that the
requirement applies to Applicants with 10 or more Employees.

unemployment; (7) emancipated from the foster care system; (8) being a
veteran; or (9) over the age of 65 and financially compromised. At a minimum,
a Licensee is required to contact local community-based organizations, City
of Los Angeles Work Source Centers, and other such similar organizations to
facilitate job outreach, development, and placement services. A Licensee is
required to provide a detailed semiannual report on the first business day of
January and the first business day of July every year that provides evidence
of its outreach efforts, including the number of persons interviewed, and
details on who was hired to satisfy the good-faith effort requirement.



 



   (n)   It shall be unlawful for a Licensee or any other party to
discriminate in any manner or take adverse action against any Employee in
retaliation for exercising rights protected under this article. These rights
include, but are not limited to: the right to file a complaint or inform any
person about any party's alleged noncompliance with this article; and the
right to inform any person of his or her potential rights under this article
and to assist him or her in asserting such rights. Protections under this
article shall apply to any Employee who mistakenly, but in good faith,
alleges noncompliance with this article. Taking adverse action against an
Employee within 90 days of the Employee's exercise of rights protected under
this article shall raise a rebuttable presumption of having done so in
retaliation for the exercise of such rights.



 



   (o)   Effective April 1, 2018, a Licensee may only transact
Commercial Cannabis business with a Person who possesses a State License for
Commercial Cannabis Activity. Failure to comply with this requirement is a
Moderate Violation under Section 104.13(b).



 



   (p)   An Applicant with Temporary Approval or a Licensee engaged in
Storefront Retail Activity (Type 10) shall display an authorized cannabis
business emblem placard as required by this Article.  If the County of Los
Angeles establishes a cannabis business emblem placard program, DCR may
require an Applicant with Temporary Approval or a Licensee engaged in
Storefront Retail Activity to participate in the program.  (Added by Ord.
No. 185,850, Eff. 11/28/18.)



 



 



SEC. 104.12.  RENEWAL AND CANCELLATION.



   (Added by Ord. No. 185,343, Eff. 12/19/17.)



 



   (a)   Every License shall be renewed annually. To renew a License, a
completed License renewal form and renewal License fee shall be received by
DCR from the Licensee no earlier than 120 calendar days before the expiration
of the License, and no later than 60 calendar days before the expiration of
the License. Failure to receive a notice for License renewal from DCR does
not relieve a Licensee of the obligation to renew a License. In the event the
License is not renewed prior to the expiration date, the Licensee shall cease
all Commercial Cannabis Activity until such time that the Licensee is issued
a new License from DCR and a license from the State of California. DCR shall
send to the Licensee a letter denying or approving the License renewal
application. The Licensee may file an administrative appeal, pursuant to
Section 104.14, within 15 days of the date of DCR sending the denial letter.
Failure to file an administrative appeal shall constitute a failure to
exhaust administrative remedies.



 



   (b)   A Licensee's security plan must comply with the Rules and
Regulations and be reviewed every year as part of the License renewal
process. As part of the License renewal process, DCR may require modification
to the Licensee's security plan.



 



   (c)   In order to receive a License renewal, a Licensee shall be in
good standing with the requirements in this article and shall not be
delinquent on any City tax or fee.  For purposes of this subsection only, a
Licensee who has entered into a payment plan with the City's Office of
Finance pursuant to LAMC Section 21.18 to pay all outstanding City-owed
business taxes shall not be deemed delinquent on any City tax.  (Amended by
Ord. No. 185,608, Eff. 7/23/18.)



 



   (d)   Any Licensee who has ceased conducting business at the
Business Premises for a period exceeding 30 consecutive calendar days, except
for bona fide remodeling pursuant to a City-issued building permit and for
not longer than a commercially reasonable period of time as determined by
DCR, shall be subject to action by DCR to suspend or revoke the License.



 



   (e)   DCR may cancel any License upon the request of the Licensee.



 



 



SEC. 104.13.  ADMINISTRATIVE VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 185,850, Eff. 11/28/18.)



 



   (a)   Violations of this Article.  Within five years of discovering
a Licensee or owner of Business Premises has violated this article, the Rules
and Regulations, or a License condition (violation), DCR may issue a Notice
of Violation (NOV) and impose any administrative penalties or order
corrective actions as provided in Section 104.13(b).  Any action of DCR does
not preclude any enforcement agency from taking its own enforcement action
for violation of any local, state or federal law or regulation.



 



   (b)   Administrative Penalties and Corrective Actions.



 



   1.   Administrative fines: In addition to any of the remedies and
penalties set forth in this article or any other law, DCR may impose
administrative fines on a Licensee or owner of a Business Premises using the
violation classes and fine amounts specified below.  The types of violations
associated with each class shall be delineated in the Rules and Regulations.



 



   (i)   "Minor" violation – amount equal to 50% of the current
Cannabis License fee for each and every violation;



 



   (ii)   "Moderate" violation – amount equal to 150% of the current
Cannabis License fee for each and every violation; and



 



   (iii)   "Serious" violation – amount equal to 300% of the current
Cannabis License fee for each and every violation.



 



   Repeat Minor or Moderate violations that occur within a two-year period
and result in an administrative fine may result in escalation to a higher
class of violation.



 



   DCR, at its discretion, may impose a reduced administrative fine after
considering factors, including: 1) the extent of harm or potential harm
caused by the violation; 2) the nature and persistence of the violation; 3)
the length of time over which the violation occurs; 4) the history of past
violations; 5) any mitigating evidence; and 6) the Licensee's or owner of the
Business Premises' financial resources.



 



   2.   License Suspension or Revocation or More Restrictive License
Conditions: In addition to any of the remedies and penalties set forth in
this article or any other law, DCR may suspend or revoke a License or impose
more restrictive License conditions after considering factors, including: 1)
the extent of harm or potential harm caused by the violation; 2) the nature
and persistence of the violation; 3) the length of time over which the
violation occurs; 4) the history of past violations; and 5) any mitigating
evidence.



 



   3.   Corrective Action: In addition to any of the remedies and
penalties set forth in this article or any other law, DCR may order a
Licensee or Business Premises owner to undertake corrective action to remedy
the violation or prevent future violations.



 



   (c)   Notice of Violation.



 



   1.   DCR shall issue a NOV by mail to the Licensee's agent for
service of process or the owner of the Business Premises as shown on the
records of the City Engineer or the records of the County Assessor.  The NOV
shall contain all of the following:



 



   (i)   a brief description of the violation;



 



   (ii)   a brief description of and rationale for the administrative
penalties and corrective action, if any, imposed; and



 



   (iii)   a timeframe in which the Licensee or owner of the Business
Premises shall take corrective action, if any, and comply with the
administrative penalties, if any, which shall not be sooner than 15 days from
the date of mailing of the NOV.



 



   The NOV shall also inform the Licensee or owner of the Business
Premises that they may request an administrative hearing, pursuant to Section
104.14, within 15 days of the date DCR mailed the NOV.  The Licensee or the
Business Premises owner's right to an administrative hearing shall be deemed
waived if he or she fails to file a timely request for an administrative
hearing.



 



   2.   The NOV shall be final and effective 15 days after the date of
its mailing if no hearing was timely requested.  If a Licensee or owner of a
Business Premises timely requests a hearing, any portion of the NOV upheld or
modified by an appellate body shall be final and effective 15 days after the
date the appellate body's decision is deemed final under Section 104.14.



 



   3.   If after a NOV becomes final and effective, a Licensee or owner
of a Business Premises fails to comply with the administrative penalties and
corrective action, if any, in the NOV, DCR may take one or more of the
following actions: 1) denial of a License renewal; 2) revocation or
suspension of a License; or 3) imposition of more restrictive License
conditions.



 



   4.   Stipulated Agreements.  Prior to or after issuing an NOV, DCR,
at its discretion, may enter into a written agreement with a Licensee or
owner of a Business Premises whereby the Licensee or owner of a Business
Premises stipulates to committing a violation in exchange for a negotiated
administrative penalty or corrective action, if any.  If a Licensee or owner
of a Business Premises violates a stipulated agreement, DCR may issue or
re-issue an NOV and impose any administrative penalties authorized under
Section 104.13(b).



 



   (d)   Administrative Hold.  To prevent destruction of evidence,
illegal diversion of Cannabis or a Cannabis product, or to address a
potential threat to the environment or public safety, DCR may order an
administrative hold of Cannabis or a Cannabis product.  DCR shall give
written notice, by mail, of the administrative hold to the Licensee and shall
provide a description of the Cannabis and/or Cannabis product subject to the
administrative hold, along with a statement for the basis of issuing the
administrative hold.  Within 24 hours of receipt of the notice of
administrative hold, the Licensee shall physically segregate all applicable
Cannabis and/or Cannabis products subject to the hold and shall safeguard and
preserve the subject property as required in the notice and the Rules and
Regulations.  Following the issuance of a notice of administrative hold to
the Licensee, DCR shall identify the Cannabis and/or Cannabis product subject
to the administrative hold in DCR's track-and-trace system.  While the
administrative hold is in effect, the Licensee is restricted from selling,
donating, transferring, transporting, or destroying the administratively held
property.  Nothing herein shall prevent a Licensee from the continued
possession, cultivation, or harvesting of Cannabis subject to the
administrative hold.  During the hold period, all Cannabis and/or Cannabis
products subject to an administrative hold shall be put into separate
batches.  Nothing herein shall prevent a Licensee from voluntarily
surrendering Cannabis and/or a Cannabis product that is subject to an
administrative hold.  The Licensee shall identify the Cannabis and/or
Cannabis product being voluntarily surrendered in DCR's track-and-trace
system.  Voluntary surrender does not waive the right to an administrative
hearing pursuant to Section 104.14 within 15 days of the date of mailing of
the written notice by DCR.

   (b)   A request for an administrative hearing shall be filed with
DCR within 15 days of the date of mailing of the notice of DCR's action,
unless a later date is provided in the notice.  Failure to timely request an
administrative hearing shall constitute a failure to exhaust administrative
remedies.  If DCR places an administrative hold on Cannabis and/or a
Cannabis product, the hold shall remain in effect pending the outcome of the
administrative hearing.



 



   (c)   DCR shall select a hearing officer and schedule an
administrative hearing within 45 calendar days from the date DCR received the
appeal, except that hearings as authorized in Section 104.07 or 104.08 shall
be scheduled within 60 days of the date DCR received the appeal.  DCR shall
mail the notice of the hearing to the appellant's agent for service of
process no later than 20 calendar days prior to the date of the hearing. 
The time for holding a hearing may be extended by mutual agreement between
DCR and the appellant.



 



   (d)   Pre-Hearing Disclosures.  No later than seven calendar days
prior to an administrative hearing, DCR and the appellant shall make the
following pre-hearing disclosures to the hearing officer, with simultaneous
email service upon the other party: (i) a brief statement of the facts and
issues relating to the appeal; (ii) a copy of all documentary evidence to be
offered at the hearing; and (iii) a list of all witnesses to be presented at
the hearing.  The hearing officer shall not issue any decision relating to
the appeal before the hearing.



 



   (e)   Administrative hearings shall be conducted as follows:



 



   1.    The hearing shall be recorded by an audio device provided by
DCR.  Any party to the hearing may, at its own expense, cause the hearing to
be audio recorded and transcribed by a certified court reporter;



 



   2.   DCR shall have the burden of proof by the preponderance of the
evidence;



 



   3.   The hearing officer may accept evidence on which persons would
commonly rely in the conduct of their business affairs;



 



   4.   The hearing officer may continue the hearing and request
additional relevant information from any party; and



 



   5.   Within 30 days of the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing
officer shall issue a written decision that includes a statement of the
factual and legal basis of the decision.  The hearing officer shall use a de
novo standard of review and may uphold or reject, in whole or in part, DCR's
action.  The hearing officer may waive or reduce the administrative
penalties in an NOV after considering the factors specified in 104.13(b).



 



   The hearing officer's decision shall be sent by mail to the appellant
and shall become final within 15 days of the mailing date, unless the
appellant files a timely appeal to the Commission, except that a hearing
officer's decision on an appeal as authorized in Section 104.07 or 104.08 is
final and shall not be appealable to the Commission.



 



   The Commission shall hold a public hearing on an appeal by the
appellant from a hearing officer's decision within 60 days of the date of
filing the appeal to the Commission.  DCR shall provide notice of the public
hearing as specified by Section 104.05(b).  The Commission shall consider de
novo the record before the hearing officer and uphold, modify or reject, in
whole or in part, the hearing officer's written decision.  The Commission
may waive or reduce the administrative penalties in the hearing officer's
decision after considering the factors specified in 104.13(b).  The
Commission shall not consider evidence outside of the record before the
hearing officer.  The Commission shall issue a decision within 30 days of
the conclusion of the hearing and mail it to the appellant.  The
Commission's decision is final.

misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 or by imprisonment
in the County Jail for a period of not more than six months, or by both a

contractor, agent or volunteer, who has no financial interest in the Unlawful

enforcement regarding medical or nonmedical Cannabis.  (Relettered by Ord.
No. 186,029, Eff. 3/14/19.)

   DCR shall administer the Rules and Regulations as adopted by the City
Council.  DCR may promulgate and enforce Rules and Regulations related to

   If any section, subsection, subdivision, clause, sentence, phrase or
portion of this article is held unconstitutional or invalid or unenforceable
by any court or tribunal of competent jurisdiction, the remaining sections,
subsections, subdivisions, clauses, sentences, phrases or portions of this
measure shall remain in full force and effect, and to this end the provisions
of this article are severable. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in

competent jurisdiction, the Commercial Cannabis Activity subject to such
licensure requirement shall be prohibited in the City.

   (Added by Ord. No. 185,343, Eff. 12/19/17.)



 



   Neither this article, nor any other provision of this Code, or action,
failure to act, statement, representation, recognition, certificate,
approval, permit or License issued by the City, DCR, the Commission, or their
respective representatives, agents, employees, attorneys or assigns, shall
create, confer, or convey any vested or nonconforming right or benefit
regarding any Commercial Cannabis Activity beyond the period of time and
range of activities specifically provided by the licenses issued by the State
of California and the City. This article does not create, confer, or convey
any right or benefit regarding any activity beyond the lawfulness of any
License issued by the City to engage in Commercial Cannabis Activity or any
applicable State of California license for such activity. If any City License
or any applicable State license is held unconstitutional, invalid or
unenforceable for any reason by any court or tribunal of competent
jurisdiction, the Commercial Cannabis Activity subject to such license shall
be prohibited in the City of Los Angeles and all operations shall immediately
cease in the City. The owner of any City License or any applicable State
license assumes all risk associated with the validity of such licenses. The
owner of any license found to be unconstitutional, invalid or unenforceable
and required thereby to cease Commercial Cannabis Activity, shall not be
entitled to any compensation from the City based upon such license; the
finding that such license is unconstitutional, invalid or unenforceable; or
the requirement that any Commercial Cannabis Activity must thereby
immediately cease in the City.

factors including but not limited to:  the order of applications received;
an applicant's financial resources; an applicant's readiness to proceed
through the application process; and, any other factor that would enable a
fair and efficient distribution of fees.  A Tier 1 Social Equity Applicant

improvements, or construction at the Business Premises identified in its
application.



 



   2.   Provide a Tier 1 or Tier 2 Social Equity Applicant an

   (a)   Emblem Program Purpose.



 



   1.   A Licensee engaged in Storefront Retail Activity shall
prominently display an Emblem Placard upon receipt from DCR, which shall
serve as notice to the public that the Licensee is authorized by the City to
engage in Storefront Retail Activity at its Business Premises.  The Emblem
Placard shall not create, confer or convey any vested or nonconforming right
or benefit, including the right to engage in Commercial Cannabis Activity, to
any Person in possession of the Emblem Placard.  The Emblem Placard may not
be sold, assigned, or otherwise transferred, and shall not be removed from
the Licensee's Business Premises without written authorization from DCR.



 



   (b)   Procedure for Issuance, Posting, Inspection, and Revocation of
Emblem Placard.

Licensees engaged in Storefront Retail Activity.  A Licensee shall not, in
any manner, copy, duplicate or reproduce an Emblem Placard provided by DCR.



 



   2.   Posting. Immediately upon receipt of an Emblem Placard, a
Licensee shall post the Emblem Placard in a location where it is clearly
visible from the exterior of the Business Premises at all times and that is
within 5 feet of the door used for patron access.  If DCR, at its
discretion, determines that the Emblem Placard would be more visible to the
general public and patrons in another location on the Business Premises, the
Licensee shall immediately move the Emblem Placard to that location.



 



   A Licensee shall ensure that at all times the Emblem Placard is
sufficiently illuminated, free from obstructions, and protected from damage,
theft and tampering.  A Licensee shall notify DCR within 24 hours after an
Emblem Placard is damaged, stolen, or otherwise lost.



 



   3.   Inspection. Not less than once per year, DCR shall inspect
every Licensee's Business Premises to determine whether the Emblem Placard is
posted in compliance with the provisions of this regulation.



 



   4.   Revocation.  If a Business Premises' License is revoked, not
renewed, or cancelled, the Licensee shall immediately remove the Emblem
Placard from public view and return the Emblem Placard to DCR.



 



   (c)   Prohibited Uses of Emblem Placard.  It shall be a violation
of this Code for any Person to display or use an Emblem Placard without
authorization from DCR, or to use any placard, symbol, or rendering that is
substantially or confusingly similar to an Emblem Placard.

   (Added by Ord. No. 185,345, Eff. 12/19/17.)



 



   The purpose of this article is to stem the negative impacts and
secondary effects associated with Cannabis related activities in the City,
including, but not limited to, those documented in case law and in the
legislative histories of cannabis regulations in the City, including but not
limited to: neighborhood disruption and intimidation caused in part by
increased transient visitors; exposure of school-age children and other
residents sensitive to cannabis; cannabis sales to minors; and violent crimes.



 



   This article is part of the City's first comprehensive set of
regulations addressing Commercial Cannabis Activity in the City. The purpose
of this article is to strike a balance to protect local communities and
neighborhoods from the known negative effects of cannabis activities, while
also to provide for Commercial Cannabis Activity recognized by State law.
This article may be reviewed by the City within four years after its adoption
with the purpose to determine whether the public health, welfare, and safety
would be served by either expanding or restricting the locations where

   This article does not create, confer, or convey any right or benefit
regarding any activity beyond the lawfulness of any License issued by the
City to engage in Commercial Cannabis Activity or any applicable State of
California license for such activity. If any City License or any applicable

ARTICLE 6
ADVERTISING OF CANNABIS AND CANNABIS PRODUCTS



 



 



Section

106.01   Relationship to Other Sign Regulations.

SEC. 106.00.  PURPOSE.



   (Added by Ord. No. 185,607, Eff. 7/23/18.)



 



   Regulating advertising of Cannabis, Cannabis Products, Cannabis
Activity, or businesses engaged in any Cannabis Activity is a reasonable and
necessary means to protect and promote the general welfare of the children
and minors of the City of Los Angeles exposed to various media advertising
Cannabis or Cannabis Products.



 



   Judicial precedent has repeatedly recognized that children and minors
deserve special concern because they lack the ability to assess and fully
analyze the information presented through advertising.



 



   Signs which can be seen from the outdoors are a unique and
distinguishable medium of advertising which subject the general public to
involuntary and unavoidable forms of solicitation.



 



   These regulations promote the general welfare and temperance of
children and minors and are intended to help reduce the illegal consumption
and purchase of Cannabis and Cannabis Products by children and minors by
limiting their exposure to the advertising of Cannabis and Cannabis Products
on certain on-site and off-site signs.



 



 



SEC. 106.01.  RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER SIGN REGULATIONS.



   (Added by Ord. No. 185,607, Eff. 7/23/18.)



 



   The provisions in this Article 6 shall supersede any conflicting
provisions of this Code, including, but not limited to, the Citywide sign
regulations set forth in Article 4.4 of Chapter I (Zoning Code).  All other
regulations in this Code not in conflict with this Article 6 shall continue
to apply to signs subject to this Article 6.  The provisions in this Article
6 are not intended to conflict with, supersede, or limit state law.



 



 



SEC. 106.02.  SUBSTITUTION CLAUSE.



   (Added by Ord. No. 185,607, Eff. 7/23/18.)
