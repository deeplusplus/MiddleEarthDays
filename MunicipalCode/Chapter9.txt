SEC. 91.101.  TITLE, PURPOSE, AND SCOPE.



 



91.101.1.  Title.  (Amended by Ord. No. 184,692, Eff. 12/30/16.)  This
article shall be known as the Los Angeles Building Code or Building Code or
LABC, a portion of the Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC), and wherever the
word Code is used in this article, it shall mean the Los Angeles Building
Code.  Sections of Article 1.5 of Chapter IX of the LAMC shall collectively
be known as the Los Angeles Residential Code or LARC.  The provisions of the
LARC for one- and two-family dwellings shall apply to the construction,
alteration, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, equipment, use and
occupancy, location, removal and demolition of detached one- and two-family
dwellings and townhouses not more than three stories above grade plane in
height with a separate means of egress and their accessory structures.  In
addition to the LARC, appropriate sections of Divisions 1, 11A, 11B, 17, 31,
31B, 33, 63, 67, 70, 71, 72, 81, 89, 92, 93 and 96 of the LABC shall also be
applicable to one- and two-family dwellings and townhouses unless stated
otherwise.



 



   The Los Angeles Building Code and the Los Angeles Residential Code
adopt by indicated reference portions of the 2016 California Building Code
(CBC) or the 2016 California Residential Code (CRC) located at Title 24 of
the California Code of Regulations (CCR).




   EXCEPTION:  Live/work units complying with the requirements of CBC
Section 419 shall be permitted to be built as one- and two-family dwellings
or townhouses.  Fire suppression required by CBC Section 419.5 when
constructed under the CRC for one- and two-family dwellings shall conform to
CBC Section 903.3.1.3.



 



91.101.2.  Purpose.  The purpose of this article is to safeguard life,
limb, health, property and public welfare by regulating and controlling the
design, construction, quality of materials, use and occupancy, location and
maintenance of all buildings and structures erected or to be erected within
the city, and by regulating certain grading operations within the city.



 



91.101.3.  Reserved.



 



91.101.4.  Scope.    (Amended by Ord. No. 180,619, Eff. 5/12/09.)  The
provisions of this Code shall apply to the construction, alteration, moving,
demolition, repair, maintenance and use of any building or structure within
this jurisdiction, except work located primarily in a public way, public
utility towers and poles, mechanical equipment not specifically regulated in
this Code, and hydraulic flood control structures.



 



   For additions, alterations, moving and maintenance of buildings and
structures, see Article 1.2, Chapter IX of the Los Angeles Municipal Code. 
For temporary buildings and structures, see CBC Section 3103.  (Amended by
Ord. No. 184,692, Eff. 12/30/16.)



 



   Where, in any specific case, different sections of this Code specify
different materials, methods of construction or other requirements, the most
restrictive shall govern.  Where there is a conflict between a general
requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be
applicable.



 



   The codes and standards referenced in this Code shall be considered
part of the requirements of this Code to the prescribed extent of each
reference.  Where differences occur between provisions of this Code and
referenced codes and standards, the provisions of this Code shall apply.



 



   Wherever in this Code reference is made to an appendix, the provisions
in the appendix shall not apply unless specifically adopted.



 



   The metric conversions are provided in parenthesis following the
English units.  Where industry has made metric conversions available, the
conversions conform to current industry standards.  Formulas are also
provided with metric equivalents.  Metric equivalent formulas immediately
follow the English formula and are denoted by “For SI” preceding the
metric equivalent.  Some formulas do not use dimensions and, thus, are not
provided with a metric equivalent.  Multiplying conversion factors have been
provided for formulas where metric forms were unavailable.  Tables are
provided with multiplying conversion factors in subheadings for each
tabulated units measurement.



 



91.101.5.  Work Not in Scope.  The provisions of this Code shall not apply
to any of the following:

shall not apply to retaining walls of any height built on slopes steeper than
1 vertical to 5 horizontal  (20% slope).



 



   5.   Water tanks supported directly upon grade if the capacity does
not exceed 5,000 gallons (18 927 L) and the ratio of the height to diameter

jurisdiction of the Department of Building and Safety.



 



   9.   Portable amusement devices and structures, including
merry-go-rounds, ferris wheels, rotating conveyances, slides, similar
devices, and portable accessory structures whose use is necessary for the
operation of such amusement devices and structures; any portable accessory
structure included in the provisions of this subdivision shall be limited to
a cover or roof over each device, but shall not include any storage building
or detached structure which is not an integral part of the device.



 



   10.   Isolated buildings not larger in area than 16 square feet,
including roof projections, and not more than 8 feet in height, if separated

   14.   Nothing in this Code shall apply to grading in an isolated,
self-contained area if the Department finds that by reason of such isolation
and self-containment no danger to private or public property can now or
thereafter result from grading operations.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587,
Eff. 7/16/18.)

Chapter 1, Division I of the CBC and any other federal, state or municipal
handicapped access or adaptability requirements.



 



   All appeals shall be reviewed by the Department.  The Department may
reverse or modify the action appealed from at any time prior to final action
by the commission.  Any such new action may then be appealed to the
commission.



 



   4.   To respond to the Department's request for advice on any matter
within the Department's jurisdiction relating to access to public
accommodations and housing by the physically disabled.

91.105.5.5.1.  Procedures.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.) 
An appeal to the Disabled Access Appeals Commission may be filed by any
person aggrieved, or by any City officer, board, department or bureau.  An
appeal shall be in writing and filed with the Office of the Board of Building
and Safety Commissioners upon appropriate forms provided by the Department. 
An appeal shall set forth specifically the points at issue, the reasons for
the appeal, and wherein the appellant believes there was an error or an abuse
of discretion by the Department.



 



   The commission shall make its determination within 30 days from the
filing of the appeal and payment of the filing fee as set forth in Table 4-A
of Division 4, Article 8, Chapter IX of the LAMC.  This time limit may be
extended by mutual written consent of the applicant and the commission. 
Upon receipt of the appeal, the commission shall set the matter for hearing
and give notice by mail of the time, place and purpose thereof to the
appellant, to the applicant, to the owner or owners of the property involved,
and to any interested party who has requested in writing to be so notified. 
Such notice shall be in writing and mailed at least 10 days prior to said
hearing.  No other notice thereof need be given except in those cases
hereinafter mentioned.



 



   The commission may grant, conditionally grant, or deny any appeal. 
All actions of the commission shall be final.  Any action within the
jurisdiction of the commission shall be final and conclusive as to the
Department in the absence of fraud or abuse of discretion.



 



   A separate appeal shall be filed for each single building as described
in LAMC Section 98.0403.2.  Appeals to the commission shall be accompanied
by a filing fee as set forth in Table 4-A of Division 4, Article 8, Chapter
IX of the LAMC.



 



   If the commission fails to act on any appeal within the time limit
specified in this section, then the action of the Department on the matter
shall be final.



 



91.105.5.5.2.  Decision.  The decision upon an appeal shall be concurred in
by at least three members of the commission. The commission may modify or
reverse a ruling, decision or determination appealed from only upon making
written findings setting forth specifically wherein the action of the
department was in error or constituted an abuse of discretion. The commission
shall make specific written findings supporting any modification or reversal.



 



   Upon making a decision, a copy of the findings and determination shall
be furnished the applicant, the appellant and the Department of Building and
Safety.



 



91.105.5.5.3.  Special Findings.  Before granting or affirming the grant of
an exception pursuant to Health and Safety Code Section 19957, the commission
must find that the application involves a case of practical difficulty,
unnecessary hardship, or extreme differences, and that it is clearly evident
that equivalent facilitation and protection will be secured.



 



91.105.5.5.4.  Revocation of Approvals.  The commission shall revoke or
rescind any determination, including the grant of an appeal or  exception,
if made in error in violation of any provision of law, or in reliance on any
false statement or misrepresentation as to a material fact.



 



91.105.5.5.5.  Time Limits.  The rights and privileges granted by the
commission pursuant to any decision, determination, approval, appeal or
exception shall be void if all required building permits are not secured
within one year of the effective date of such action, or if the permit
expires under any of the conditions specified in Section 98.0602 of the Los
Angeles Municipal Code.



 



   However, the commission, and the superintendent acting on behalf of the
commission, may grant extensions of time if the applicant submits in writing
substantial evidence that unusual conditions or circumstances either
precluded the securing of all required permits within the allocated time or
caused the permit to expire as specified in Section 98.0602 of the Los
Angeles Municipal Code.



 



   Requests for extensions of time shall be made not later than 30 days
after the expiration times specified in this section.



 



91.105.5.5.6.  Additional Authority.  In considering appeals, the
commission may exercise the following powers:



 



   1.   To appoint one or more hearing officers to conduct hearings and

Superintendent of Building acting pursuant to LAMC Section 98.0601 (a). 
(Amended by Ord. No. 180,619, Eff. 5/12/09.)



 



   2.   To request the attendance of witnesses and the production of
evidence before it.

commission.



 



   4.   To adopt rules regarding the filing of appeals, the conduct of
its hearings and any other procedural rules in keeping with the provisions of
this Division.



 



91.105.5.5.7.  Limitations on Jurisdiction.  Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Code, the commission’s jurisdiction shall not include the
right to hear and determine an appeal from a department determination, order
or action if such appeal is filed:



 



   1.   On or after the date a criminal citation is issued, charging
the appellant with a violation of law based on the facts underlying such
determination, order or action; or



 



   2.   On or after the date a criminal complaint is filed, charging
the appellant with a violation of state laws based on such determination,
order or action.

91.105.6.1.  Order of Abatement and Notice of Proposed Penalty.  If the
Superintendent of Building determines that a person has violated or failed to
comply with any requirement of the law relating to access to public
accommodations and housing by the physically disabled, then the
Superintendent of Building may issue an order of abatement and notice of
proposed penalty to that person.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff.
7/16/18.)



 



   The order and notice shall be in writing and shall describe with
particularity the nature of the violation, including a reference to the
provision of law that has been violated. The order shall fix a reasonable
time for correction of the violation, and the notice of proposed penalty
shall set forth the amount of the penalty.



 



   The order of abatement and notice of proposed penalty shall be served
upon the person either personally, or by deposit in the United States mail in
a sealed envelope, postage prepaid to the person’s last known address.



 



   The order and notice shall also set forth the person's right to a
hearing as described in LAMC Subdivision 91.105.6.2.  (Amended by Ord. No.
185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)



 



91.105.6.2.  Right to Hearing.  Any person served with an order of
abatement or notice of proposed penalty, may apply in writing to the Disabled
Access Appeals Commission for a hearing with respect to the violation
alleged, the abatement period, and the amount of the penalty. This request
shall be filed within 15 days after the date of service.



 



   If the person does not request a hearing within the prescribed time,
then the notice of proposed penalty shall be final, and the amount of any
penalty included in the notice shall immediately be due and owing to the City
of Los Angeles. The city then shall have the right to bring an action in any
court of competent jurisdiction to enforce the order and collect the amount
of the penalty.



 



   If the department determines that there has been compliance with the
order of abatement within the time for correction, then the department may
rescind the notice of penalty.



 



91.105.6.3.  Time of Hearing; Notice.  If the person requests a hearing,
the superintendent shall cause the matter to be set for hearing before the
Disabled Access Appeals Commission. The hearing shall be scheduled not later
than 30 days after the date of the application for hearing. This time limit
may be extended with the mutual consent of the person and the commission. It
shall be a defense to the affirmation of any penalty that the person complied
with the order of abatement within the time for correction.



 



   The decision of the commission on the order of abatement and notice of
proposed penalty shall be final, and the amount of any penalty affirmed by
the commission shall immediately be due and owing to the City of Los Angeles.
The city then shall have the right to bring an action in any court of
competent jurisdiction to enforce the order and collect the amount of penalty.

provisions of this section is a debt owed to the City of Los Angeles. Any
person owing a penalty due under the provisions of this section shall be
liable in an action brought in the name of the City of Los Angeles in any
court of competent jurisdiction for recovery of any such amount.



 



   The conviction of any person for violating any law shall not relieve
the person from the obligation to pay any penalty that the person may owe the
city, nor shall such payment prevent a prosecution under appropriate
provisions of law for any violation of the law. The remedies provided in this
section are cumulative. The use of one or more of the remedies prescribed in
this section shall not bar the use of any other remedy provided for the
enforcement of law.



 



91.105.6.5.  Fee Schedules.  The Superintendent shall submit a schedule for
the assessment of civil penalties under this section to council for the
approval by ordinance.



 



   This schedule shall give due consideration to the appropriateness of
the penalty with respect to the following factors:



 



   1.   The gravity of the violation;



 



   2.   The good faith of the violator being charged; and



 



   3.   The history of previous violations.

   Any grading project involving more than 100 cubic yards (76.5 m 3 ) of
excavation and involving an excavation in excess of 5 feet (1524 mm) in
vertical depth at its deepest point measured from the original ground surface
shall be done by a State of California licensed contractor who is licensed to

91.106.4.2.2.  Inspection and Reproduction of Retained Plans.



 



91.106.4.2.2.1.  Inspection of Plans.  The copy of the approved building
plans maintained by the department as provided by Section 91.106.4.2.1 of the
Los Angeles Municipal Code shall be available for inspection only on the
premises of the department.



 



   EXCEPTION:  Plans or portion of plans for banks, other financial
institutions or public utilities which are maintained by the department may
not be inspected without written permission from the owner of the building.



 



91.106.4.2.2.2.  Reproduction of Plans.  (Amended by Ord. No. 171,185, Eff.
7/22/96.)  Plans maintained by the Department under Subdivision 1 of this
subsection may not be duplicated in whole or in part except with the written
permission of the certified, licensed or registered professional or his or
her successor, if any, who signed the original documents, and the written
permission of the original or current owner of the building, or, if the
building is part of a common interest development, with the written
permission of the board of directors or governing body of the association
established to manage the common interest development; or by order of a
proper court.  In implementing this provision, the Department shall comply
with the requirements of Health and Safety Code Section 19851.



 



   The Department shall also furnish the form of an affidavit to be
completed and signed by the person requesting to duplicate the official copy
of the plans, which contains provisions stating all of the following:



 



   1.   That the copy of the plans shall only be used for the
maintenance, operation, and use of the building.



 



   2.   That drawings are instruments of professional service and are
incomplete without the interpretation of the certified, licensed, or
registered professional of record.



 



   3.   That Subdivision (a) of Section 5536.25 of the Business and
Professions Code states that a licensed architect who signs plans,
specifications, reports, or documents shall not be responsible for damage
caused by subsequent changes to, or use of, those plans, specifications,
reports, or documents where the subsequent changes or uses, including changes
or uses made by state or local governmental agencies, are not authorized or
approved by the licensed architect who originally signed the plans,
specifications, reports, or documents, provided that the architectural
service rendered by the architect who signed the plans, specifications,
reports, or documents was not also a proximate cause of the damage.



 



   Grading plans which are on file with the Department are public records
and may be duplicated.



 



   The fees specified in the following provisions 1 or 2 shall be paid by
the person requesting duplication of plans:



 



   1.   Building plans that have not been microfilmed and are
authorized for reproduction, and grading plans that are to be duplicated by
other than City services will be released only to a bonded duplicating
service which has posted a bond for the benefit of the City of Los Angeles in
an amount at least equal to the value of the plans.



 



   The cost of duplicating the plans shall be paid directly to the
duplicating service by the persons requesting duplication.  That person
shall pay a service fee of $15.00 for each set of plans released to a bonded
duplicating service as herein provided.



 



   2.   Building plans that have been microfilmed and are authorized
for reproduction shall be duplicated by City services.  The Department shall
collect an initial service fee of $8.00 for each request for reproduction of
plans plus a fee of $1.00 for each sheet requested to be photocopied.



 



91.106.4.2.3.  Compliance.  A certified copy of the microfilmed plans shall
constitute compliance with the requirement of this section.



 



91.106.4.3.  Validity of Permit.



 



91.106.4.3.1.  Limit of Authorization.  The issuance of a permit is not an
approval or an authorization of the work specified therein. A permit is
merely an application for inspection, the issuance of which entitles the
permittee to inspection of the work which is described therein.



 



   Permits issued under the requirements of this Code shall not relieve
the owner of responsibility for securing required permits for work to be done
which is regulated by any other Code, department or division of the City of
Los Angeles.



 



   All permits are issued subject to the following conditions:



 



   If the work described by a valid permit is prohibited by a change in
the Los Angeles Municipal Code, then such work may be completed only if the
department determines that both substantial liabilities have been incurred,
and substantial work has been performed on site, in accordance with the terms
of that permit. Work performed and liabilities incurred pursuant to a
demolition or relocation permit shall not be considered in determining
whether an owner may complete a building or structure for which a building
permit has been issued.



 



91.106.4.3.2.  Validity of Other Laws. Neither the issuance of a permit nor
the approval by the department of any document shall constitute an approval
of any violation of any provision of this Code or of any other law or
ordinance, and a permit or other document purporting to give authority to
violate any law shall not be valid with respect thereto.



 



91.106.4.3.3.  Official Grades.  The applicant shall satisfy himself as to
the correctness of proposed structure elevations and locations with respect
to the official grades of public streets and to the policy of the Board of
Public Works relative to the location and length of curb depressions for
driveways.



 



91.106.4.3.4.  Easements.  Before issuing any permit, the department shall
require a declaration, under penalty of perjury, from the owner or agent
having the property owner’s consent stating that:



 



   “The proposed work will not destroy or unreasonably interfere with
any access or utility easement belonging to others and located on my
property, but in the event such work does destroy or unreasonably interfere
with such easement, a substitute easement(s) satisfactory to the holder(s) of
the easement will be provided.”



 



91.106.4.4.  Expiration, Suspension or Revocation.



 



91.106.4.4.1.  General.  The regulations concerning the expiration,
suspension and revocation of permits are enumerated in Chapter IX Article 8,
Division 6, of the Los Angeles Municipal Code.



 



91.106.4.4.2.  Making False Statements to the Department.  Any person who
willfully or knowingly, with the intent to deceive, makes a false statement
or representation, or knowingly fails to disclose a material fact in any
documentation required by the Department shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. 
(Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)



 



91.106.4.4.3.  Unfinished Buildings or Structures. Whenever the department
determines by inspection that work on any building or structure for which a
permit has been issued and the work started thereon has been suspended for a
period of 180 days or more, the owner of the property upon which such
structure is located, or other person or agent in control of said property,
upon receipt of notice in writing from the department to do so, shall, within
90 days from the date of such written notice, obtain a new permit to complete
the required work and diligently pursue the work to completion, or shall
remove or demolish the building or structure within 180 days from the date of
the written notice.



 



91.106.4.5.  Permits for Historical and Cultural Buildings.  The department
shall not issue a permit to demolish, alter or remove a building or structure
of historical, archaeological or architectural consequence if such building
or structure has been officially designated, or has been determined by state
or federal action to be eligible for designation, on the National Register of
Historic Places, or has been included on the City of Los Angeles list of
historic cultural monuments, without the department having first determined
whether the demolition, alteration or removal may result in the loss of or
serious damage to a significant historical or cultural asset.  If the
department determines that such loss or damage may occur, the applicant shall
file an application and pay all fees for the California Environmental Quality
Act Initial Study and Check List, as specified in Section 19.05 of the Los
Angeles Municipal Code. If the Initial Study and Check List identifies the
historical or cultural asset as significant, the permit shall not be issued
without the department first finding that specific economic, social or other
considerations make infeasible the preservation of the building or structure.



 



91.106.4.5.1. Notification of Demolition. (Amended by Ord. No. 186,484, Eff.
1/28/20.)  The Department shall not issue a building permit for demolition
of a building or structure for which the original building permit was issued
more than 45 years prior to the date of submittal of the application for
demolition pre-inspection, or where information submitted with the
application indicates that the building or structure is more than 45 years
old based on the date the application is submitted, without having first
provided the following required notice and taken the following required
actions at least 30 days prior to issuance of the demolition of building or
structure permit:



 



   1.   The Department shall send written notice of the demolition
pre-inspection application via U.S. mail to the abutting property owners and
occupants, as well as the City Council District Office and Certified
Neighborhood Council Office representing the site, for which a demolition
pre-inspection has been proposed for a building or structure as defined by
the Los Angeles Municipal Code.



 



   2.   The applicant shall post a placard on the property where the
demolition will occur, in a conspicuous, visible place, within 5 feet of the
front property line, describing the date of the application for demolition
pre-inspection with the following standards:



 



   A.   The placard shall be a minimum 11" x 17" in size and mounted at
a minimum of four feet above the ground.



 



   B.   The placard shall have black letters on contrasting background
white or color paper.



 



   C.   The placard shall have major block-style letters a minimum
2-1/2 inches in height and shall state: "NOTICE OF DEMOLITION". Minor letters
1-1/2 inches in height shall specify the permit number and the phone number
to be called for information.



 



   D.   The placard material shall be made of durable, laminated or
other weather resistant material.



 



   3.   The Department shall verify the placement of the placard prior
to commencement of the demolition work.



 



   4.   All applicable protection devices (i.e., fences and/or
pedestrian protection canopies) shall be installed and approved by the
Department prior to demolition work and maintained during demolition, in
accordance with LAMC Sections 91.3306 and 91.3307.  The Department shall
verify the placement of these devices prior to the commencement of demolition
work.



 



91.106.4.5.2.  (Amended by Ord. No. 186,484, Eff. 1/28/20.)  The applicant
seeking the permit shall provide the Department with the names of and
addresses of all persons entitled to receive notice pursuant to LAMC
Subsection 91.106.4.5.1.



 



91.106.4.5.3. (Amended by Ord. No. 186,484, Eff. 1/28/20.)  The Department
shall collect a fee in the amount of $60.00 when an application for the
demolition of a building or structure described in LAMC Subsection
91.106.4.5.1 is filed with the Department.  This fee shall be charged in
addition to applicable demolition pre-inspection fees set forth at LAMC
Subsection 91.107.3.2.



 



91.106.4.5.4. (Amended by Ord. No. 186,484, Eff. 1/28/20.)  LAMC Subsections
91.106.4.5.1, 91.106.4.5.2, and 91.106.4.5.3 shall not apply to a building or
structure as described in LAMC Subsection 91.106.4.5.1 that is the subject of
a pending zoning application for a specific plan filed prior to January 12,
2015.  In the event a specific plan for such property is not approved within
3 years from January 12, 2015, such property shall be required to comply with
the provisions of LAMC Subsections 91.106.4.5.1, 91.106.4.5.2, and
91.106.4.5.3.  Insofar as the provisions of LAMC Subsections 91.106.4.5.1,
91.106.4.5.2, and 91.106.4.5.3 are different than or in conflict with the
provisions of a specific plan, the provisions of the specific plan shall
govern.



 



91.106.4.5.5. (Amended by Ord. No. 186,484, Eff. 1/28/20.)  LAMC Subsections

structure as described in LAMC Subsection 91.106.4.5.1 that will be
demolished as part of a project that was subject to California Environmental
Quality Act review and for which the corresponding discretionary project
approval was issued prior to submittal of the application for demolition
pre-inspection.



 



91.106.4.6. Notification and Posting in a Hillside Grading Area.

   1.   The department shall send written notices of the permit
application, by mail, to the owners of all property abutting the property at
which the construction or grading will occur. Notices shall also be sent to
the owners of all property across the street or alley when such property is
intersected by a projection of the lot lines of the property at which the
construction or grading will occur; and



 



   2.   The department shall post a notice of the permit application on
the property at which the construction or grading will occur.

91.106.5.  Solar Permitting.  (Added by Ord. No. 183,892, Eff. 11/8/15.)



 



91.106.5.1.  Streamlined Permitting Process for Small Residential Rooftop
Solar Energy Systems.  A solar energy system, as defined in California Civil
Code Section 801.5(a), that satisfies all of the following requirements shall
be eligible for streamlined permitting process:



 



   1.   It is no larger than 10 kilowatts alternating current nameplate
rating or 30 kilowatts thermal;



 



   2.   It conforms to all applicable state and local fire, structural,
electrical and other building codes;



 



   3.   It meets all applicable safety and performance standards
established by the California Electrical Code, the Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers and accredited testing laboratories such as
Underwriters Laboratories and, where applicable, rules of the Public
Utilities Commission regarding safety and reliability;



 



   4.   It is installed on a single or duplex family dwelling; and



 



   5.   Its solar panels or module arrays do not exceed the maximum
legal building height, which includes the height allowances provided by
Section 12.21.1 B.3.(c) of the Los Angeles Municipal Code.



 



   The Department shall publish on a publicly accessible internet site all
required permitting documentation and a checklist of all requirements with
which such solar energy systems must comply to be eligible for streamlined
review.  The Department shall use the checklist and standard plans contained
in the most current version of the California Solar Permitting Guidebook and
adopted by the Governor's Office of Planning and Research.  The Department
shall allow online submittal of permit applications and associated
documentation, and shall authorize the electronic signature of all forms,
applications and other documentation in lieu of a wet signature.



 



   A permit application that the Department determines satisfies the
information requirements in the checklist shall be deemed complete.  Upon
confirmation that an application is complete and that the proposed solar
energy system complies with all requirements of the Los Angeles Municipal
Code, the Department shall approve the application and issue all required
permits in a timely manner in substantial conformance with the
recommendations of the California Solar Permitting Guidebook.  Upon receipt
of an incomplete application, the Department shall issue a written correction
notice detailing all deficiencies in the application and any additional
information required to be eligible for streamlined permit issuance.



 



   Except as provided herein, a solar energy system eligible for
streamlined review shall be subject to no more than one inspection, which
shall be done in a timely manner in substantial conformance with the
recommendations of the California Solar Permitting Guidebook and may involve
multiple agencies.  If the eligible solar energy system fails the
inspection, a subsequent inspection may be required.  This section does not
preclude the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power from conducting
separate inspections for the interconnection of a solar energy system to the
electricity grid.



 



   The Department need not approve an application or issue permits under
this section if the Department makes a finding, based on substantial
evidence, that the solar energy system could have a specific, adverse impact
upon the public health or safety.  "Specific, adverse impact" means a
significant, quantifiable, direct and unavoidable impact, based on objective,
identified and written public health or safety standards, policies or
conditions as they existed on the date the application was deemed complete.

cents, provided, however, no fee shall exceed the reasonable cost of
providing services.  When it is determined that the amount reasonably
necessary to recover the cost of providing services is in excess of this
adjustment, the Superintendent of Building may present fee proposals to the
City Council for approval.  (Added by Ord. No. 180,868, Eff. 10/22/09.)

the Superintendent of Building finds that no substantial hazard will result
from the occupancy of any building, or portion thereof, before the same is
completed, and satisfactory evidence is submitted that the work could not
have been completed prior to the time such occupancy is desired because of

duplication fee required by ordinance.

authority, in writing, to suspend or revoke a Certificate of Occupancy or
Temporary Certificate of Occupancy issued under the provisions of this Code

information supplied, or when it is determined that the building or structure
or portion of the building or structure is in violation of any ordinance or
regulation or any of the provisions of this Code.  (Amended by Ord. No.

   Section 1207 of the CBC is adopted by reference, except CBC Sections
1207.1, is not adopted and in lieu, LAMC Subsections and Subdivisions
91.1207.1, 91.1207.1.2, 91.1207.6, 91.1207.7, 91.1207.8, 91.1207.9,

91.1207.17 are added.



 



91.1207.1.  Purpose and Scope.  The purpose of this section is to establish
uniform minimum noise insulation performance standards to protect persons
within new hotels, motels, dormitories, residential care facilities,
apartment houses, dwellings, private schools, and places of worship from the
effects of excessive noise, including but not limited to, hearing loss or
impairment and interference with speech and sleep.



 



91.1207.1.2.  Definitions.  The following special definitions shall apply
to this section:



 



   SOUND TRANSMISSION CLASS (STC) is a single-number rating used to
compare walls, floor-ceiling assemblies and doors for their sound-insulating
properties with respect to speech and small household appliance noise.  The
STC is derived from laboratory measurements of sound transmission loss across
a series of 16 test bands.  Laboratory STC ratings should be used to the
greatest extent possible in determining that the design complies with this
section.



 



   FIELD SOUND TRANSMISSION CLASS (FSTC) is a single-number rating similar
to STC, except that the transmission loss values used to derive the FSTC are
measured in the field.  All sound transmitted from the source room to the
receiving room is assumed to be through the separating wall or floor-ceiling
assembly.  This section does not require determination of the FSTC, and
field-measured values of noise reduction should not be reported as
transmission loss.



 



   IMPACT INSULATION CLASS (IIC) is a single-number rating used to compare
the effectiveness of floor-ceiling assemblies in providing reduction of
impact-generated sounds such as footsteps.  The IIC is derived from
laboratory measurements of impact sound pressure level across a series of 16
test bands using a standardized tapping machine.  Laboratory IIC ratings
should be used to the greatest extent possible in determining that the design
complies with this section.



 



   FIELD IMPACT INSULATION CLASS (FIIC) is a single-number rating similar
to the IIC, except that the impact sound pressure levels are measured in the
field.



 



   NOISE ISOLATION CLASS (NIC) is a single-number rating derived from
measured values of noise reduction between two enclosed spaces that are
connected by one or more paths.  The NIC is not adjusted or normalized to a
standard reverberation time.



 



   NORMALIZED NOISE ISOLATION CLASS (NNIC) is a single-number rating
similar to the NIC, except that the measured noise reduction values are
normalized to a reverberation time of one-half second.



 



   NORMALIZED A-WEIGHTED SOUND LEVEL DIFFERENCE (Dn) means for a specified
source room sound spectrum, Dn is the difference, in decibels, between the
average sound levels produced in two rooms after adjustment to the expected
acoustical conditions when the receiving room under test is normally
furnished.



 



   DAY-NIGHT AVERAGE SOUND LEVEL (Ldn) is the A-weighted equivalent
continuous sound exposure level for a 24-hour period with a 10 db adjustment
added to sound levels occurring during nighttime hours (10 p.m. to 7 a.m.).



 



   COMMUNITY NOISE EQUIVALENT LEVEL (CNEL) is a metric similar to the Ldn,
except that a 5 db adjustment is added to the equivalent continuous sound
exposure level for evening hours (7 p.m. to 10 p.m.) in addition to the 10 db
nighttime adjustment used in the Ldn.



 



91.1207.6.  Relevant Standards.  The current edition of the following
standards is generally applicable for determining compliance with this
section, copies may be obtained from the American Society for Testing and
Materials (ASTM) at 100 Barr Harbor Drive, West Conshohocken, PA,
19428-2959:  ASTM C 634, Standard Terminology Relating to Building and
Environmental Acoustics; ASTME 90, Standard Test Method for Laboratory
Measurement of Airborne Sound Transmission Loss of Building Partitions and
Elements; ASTM E 336, Standard Test Method for Measurement of Airborne Sound
Attenuation Between Rooms in Buildings; ASTM E 413, Classification for Rating
Sound Insulation; ASTM E 492, Standard Test Method for Laboratory Measurement
of Impact Sound Transmission Through Floor-Ceiling Assemblies Using the
Tapping Machine; ASTM E 497, Standard Recommended Practice for Installation
of Fixed Partitions of Light Frame Type for the Purpose of Conserving Their

Sound Insulation of Building Facades and Facade Elements; ASTM E 989,
Standard Classification for Determination of Impact Insulation Class (IIC);
ASTM E 1007, Standard Test Method for Field Measurement of Tapping Machine
Impact Sound Transmission Through Floor-Ceiling Assemblies and Associated
Support Structures; and ASTM E 1014, Standard Guide for Measurement of
Outdoor A-Weighted Sound Levels.



 



91.1207.7.  Complaints.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.) 
Where a complaint as to noncompliance with this division requires a field
test, the complainant shall post a bond or adequate funds in escrow for the
cost of the field test.  Such costs shall be chargeable to the complainant
if the field tests show compliance with this division.  If the tests show
noncompliance, testing costs shall be borne to the owner or builder.



 



91.1207.8.  Local Modification.  The governing body of any city or county
or city and county may, by ordinance, adopt changes or modifications to the
requirements of this section as set forth in Section 17922.7 of the Health
and Safety Code.



 



91.1207.9.  Interdwelling Sound Transmission Control.



 



91.1207.9.1.  Wall and Floor-Ceiling Assemblies.  Wall and floor-ceiling
assemblies separating dwelling units or guest rooms from each other and from
public or service areas such as interior corridors, garages and mechanical
spaces shall provide airborne sound insulation for walls, and both airborne
and impact sound insulation for floor-ceiling assemblies.



 



   EXCEPTION:  Impact sound insulation is not required for floor-ceiling
assemblies over nonhabitable rooms or spaces not designed to be occupied,
such as garages, mechanical rooms or storage areas.



 



91.1207.10.  Airborne Sound Insulation.  All such acoustically rated
separating wall and floor-ceiling assemblies shall provide airborne sound
insulation equal to that required to meet a sound transmission class (STC)
rating of 50 based on laboratory tests as defined in ASTM E 90 and E 413. 
Field-tested assemblies shall meet a noise isolation class (NIC) rating of 45
for occupied units and a normalized noise isolation class (NINIC) rating of
45 for unoccupied units as defined in ASTM E 336 and E 413.  ASTM E 597 may
be used as simplified procedure for field tests of the airborne sound
isolation between rooms in unoccupied buildings.  In such tests, the minimum
value of Dn is 45 db for compliance.  Entrance doors from interior corridors
together with their perimeter seals shall have STC ratings not less than
26.  Such tested doors shall operate normally with commercially available
seals.  Solid-core wood-slab doors 1 3/8 inches (35 mm) thick minimum or 18
gauge insulated steel-slab doors with compression seals all around, including
the threshold, may be considered adequate without other substantiating
information.  Field tests of corridor walls should not include segments with
doors.  If such tests are impractical, however, the NIC or NNIC rating for
the composite wall-door assembly shall not be less than 30.  Penetrations or
openings in construction assemblies for piping, electrical devices, recessed
cabinets, bathtubs, soffits or heating, ventilating or exhaust ducts shall be
sealed, lined, insulated or otherwise treated to maintain the required
ratings.



 



91.1207.11.  Impact Sound Insulation.  All acoustically rated separating
floor-ceiling assemblies shall provide impact sound insulation equal to that
required to meet a IIC rating of 50 based on laboratory tests as defined in
ASTM E 492 and E 989.  Field-tested assemblies shall meet a field impact
insulation class (FIIC) rating of 45 for both occupied and unoccupied units
as defined in ASTM E 1007 and E 989, with the exception that the measured
impact sound pressure levels shall not be normalized to a standard amount of
absorption in the receiving room.  Floor coverings may be included in the
assembly to obtain the required ratings.  These coverings must be retained
as a permanent part of the assembly and may be replaced only by other floor
coverings that provide the required impact sound insulation.



 



91.1207.12.  Tested Assemblies.  Laboratory-tested wall or floor-ceiling
designs having STC or IIC ratings of 50 or more may be used by the Building
Official to determine compliance with this section during plan review
phase.  Field tests shall be required by the Building Official when evidence
of sound leaks or flanking paths is noted, or when the separating assembly is
not built according to the approved design.  Generic sound transmission
control systems as listed in the Catalog of STC and IIC Ratings for Wall and
Floor-Ceiling Assemblies, as published by the Office of Noise Control,
California Department of Health Services, or the Fire Resistance Design
Manual, as published by the Gypsum Association, may be used to evaluate
construction assemblies for their sound transmission properties.  Other
tests from recognized laboratories may also be used.  When ratings for
essentially similar assemblies differ, and when ratings are below STC or IIC
50, field testing may be used to demonstrate that the building complies with
this section.  For field testing, rooms should ideally be large and
reverberant for reliable measurements to be made in all test bands.  This is
often not possible for bathrooms, kitchens, hallways or rooms with large
amounts of sound-absorptive materials.  Field test results should, however,
report the measured values in all bands, noting those which do not meet
relevant ASTM criteria for diffusion.  It should be noted that STC ratings
do not adequately characterize the sound insulation of construction
assemblies when the intruding noise is predominantly low-pitched, as is often
produced by amplified music or by large pieces of mechanical equipment.  It
should also be noted that the transmission of impact sound from a
standardized tapping machine may vary considerably for a given design due to
differences in specimen size, flanking transmission through associated
structure and the acoustical response of the room below.  Laboratory IIC
values should therefore be used with caution when estimating the performance
of hard-surfaced floors in the field.  Additionally, IIC ratings may not
always be adequate to characterize the subjectively annoying creak or boom
generated by footfalls on a lumber floor.



 



91.1207.13.  Certification.  Field testing, when required, shall be done
under the supervision of a person experienced in the field of acoustical
testing and engineering, who shall forward test results to the Building
Official showing that the sound isolation requirements stated above have been
met.  Documentation of field test results should generally follow the
requirements outlined in relevant ASTM standards.



 



91.1207.14.  Exterior Sound Transmission Control.



 



91.1207.14.1.  Application Consistent with Local Land-Use Standards. 
(Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)  All structures identified in
LAMC Subsection 91.1207.1 located in noise critical areas, such as proximity
to highways, country roads, city streets, railroads, rapid transit lines,
airports or industrial areas shall be designed to prevent the intrusion of
exterior noises beyond prescribed levels.  Proper design shall include, but
shall not be limited to, orientation of the structure, setbacks, shielding
and sound insulation of the building itself.



 



91.1207.14.2.  Allowable Interior Noise Levels.  Interior noise levels
attributable to exterior sources shall not exceed 45 db in any habitable
room.  The noise metric shall be either the day-night average sound level
(Ldn) or the community noise equivalent level (CNEL), consistent with the
noise element of the local general plan.



 



   Note:  Ldn is the preferred metric for implementing these standards. 
Worst-case noise levels, either existing or future, shall be used as the
basis for determining compliance with this section.  Future noise levels
shall be predicted for a period of at least ten (10) years from the time of
building permit application.



 



91.1207.14.3.  Airport Noise Sources.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff.
7/16/18.)  Residential structures and all other structures identified in
LAMC Subsection 91.1207.1 located where the annual Ldn or CNEL (as defined in
California Code of Regulations, Title 21, Division 2.5, Chapter 6, Section
5001) exceeds 60 db, shall require an acoustical analysis showing that the
proposed design will achieve the prescribed allowable interior level.



 



   EXCEPTION: New single-family detached dwellings and all non-residential
noise sensitive structures located outside the noise impact boundary of 65 db
CNEL are exempt from LAMC Section 91.1207.



 



   Alterations or additions to all noise sensitive structures, within the
65 db and greater CNEL shall comply with LAMC Section 91.1207.  If the
addition or alteration cost exceeds 75% of the replacement cost of the
existing structure, then the entire structure must comply with LAMC Section
91.1207.



 



   For public-use airports or heliports, the Ldn or CNEL shall be
determined from the Aircraft Noise Impact Area Map prepared by the Airport
Authority.  For military bases, the Ldn shall be determined from the
facility Air Installation Compatible Use Zone (AICUZ) plan.  For all other
airports or heliports, or public-use airports or heliports for which a
land-use plan has not been developed, the Ldn or CNEL shall be determined
from the noise element of the general plan of the local jurisdiction.



 



   When aircraft noise is not the only significant source, noise levels
from all sources shall be added to determine the composite site noise level.



 



91.1207.15.4.  Other Noise Sources.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff.
7/16/18.)  All structures identified in LAMC Subsection 91.1207.1 located
where the Ldn or CNEL exceeds 60 db shall require an acoustical analysis
showing that the proposed design will limit exterior noise to the prescribed
allowable interior level.  The noise element of the local general plan shall
be used to the greatest extent possible to identify sites with noise levels
potentially greater than 60db.



 



91.1207.16.  Compliance.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.) 
Evidence of compliance shall be submitted with the application for a building
permit for all structures identified in LAMC Subsection 91.1207.1.  Evidence
of compliance shall consist of the submittal of an acoustical analysis report
prepared under the supervision of a person experienced in the field of
acoustical engineering or the use of prescriptive standards as determined by
the Superintendent of Building for residential structures.  The report shall
show topographical relationships of noise sources and dwelling sites,
identification of noise sources and their characteristics, predicted noise
spectra and levels at the exterior of the proposed structure considering
present and future land usage, the basis for the prediction (measured or
obtained from published data), the noise attenuation measures to be applied,
and an analysis of the noise insulation effectiveness of the proposed
construction showing that the prescribed interior level requirements are met.



 



   If interior allowable noise levels are met by requiring that windows be
unopenable or closed, the design for the structure must also specify a
ventilation or air-conditioning system to provide a habitable interior

91.1207.17.  Field Testing.  When inspection indicates that the
construction is not in accordance with the approved design, or that the noise
reduction is compromised due to sound leaks or flanking paths, field testing
may be required.  A test report showing compliance or noncompliance with
prescribed interior allowable levels shall be submitted to the building
official.  Measurements of outdoor sound levels shall generally follow the
guidelines in ASTM E 1014.  Field measurements of the A-weighted airborne
sound insulation of buildings from exterior sources shall generally follow
the guidelines in ASTM E 966.  For the purpose of this standard, sound level
differences measured in unoccupied units shall be normalized to a receiving
room reverberation time of one-half second.  Sound level differences
measured in occupied units shall not be normalized to a standard
reverberation time.

be re-examined to ascertain the applicant's fitness to perform the duties of
inspector of the type for which application has been made.  (Amended by Ord.
No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)



 



   EXCEPTION:  If the Department determines that the initial examination
(which includes general knowledge, code requirements and plan comprehension)
for the special inspector program under the International Code Council (ICC)
is equivalent to the above-described initial or renewal examination, then the
Department may accept the results of the ICC examination in lieu of the
Department's examination in that category; however, the Department will be
examining the applicant's knowledge of the LAMC and Registered Deputy
Inspector duties, responsibilities and procedures.  (Amended by Ord. No.
185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)



 



   The Superintendent of Building shall issue a separate Certificate of
Registration for each type of registration requiring special inspection in
accordance with LAMC Sections 91.1704 and 91.1707 and as determined by the
Superintendent of Building for any construction requiring either continuous
or periodic special inspection.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)



 



   Nothing here shall be deemed to prohibit any one person from being
qualified for more than one type of special inspection, provided he or she
applies, pays the required fees, takes the required examinations and is duly
qualified by the Superintendent of Building for each type.

incompetence, of willful or negligent failure to observe or report violations
of this Code, or of any other failure to perform properly and effectively the
duties assumed by a Registered Deputy Inspector, the Superintendent of
Building may revoke, suspend or refuse to renew any Certificate of
Registration.  But, prior to that action, the holder shall be given an
opportunity to appear before the Superintendent of Building and be heard.



 



   Except where there is a City employee inspecting buildings or
structures being erected or repaired by the City, no Registered Deputy
Inspector shall receive any compensation from the City.  A Registered Deputy
Inspector shall undertake and perform the duties of inspection solely on the
request of the owner or the owner's agent.  The designation shall be deemed
to indicate that the duties incident to the inspection are within the course
and scope of the Registered Deputy Inspector's employment by the owner or
agent, and except where the Registered Deputy Inspector is in fact an
employee of the City, the Registered Deputy Inspector shall not be deemed an
employee of the City, a contractor, a subcontractor or a material vendor for
any purpose.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)

Department that to the best of his or her knowledge the field work was
completed in conformity with the technical design data.



 



91.1705.1.3.  Department's Responsibility.  The employment of a Registered
Deputy Inspector for any work does not deprive the Department of the right to
make periodic or called inspections of all or portions of the work.  On any
work requiring continuous inspection by a Registered Deputy Inspector, the
called inspections required by Section 91.108 of this Code may be delegated
to the Registered Deputy Inspector by the Superintendent of Building.



 



91.1705.1.4.  Structural, Termite and Fungus Damage.  Every building raised
from its foundation shall be inspected.  If there is any superficial

Eff. 7/16/18.)  In addition to the construction or work inspected as
described in LAMC Sections 91.108 and 91.1704 through 91.1705, there are
other construction activities that are sufficiently important to the
structural stability of the structure, the occupants of and the fire and life
safety of the structure that inspection by a specially qualified inspector is
necessary in order to ensure compliance with the Code requirements.  These
special activity inspections may occur during off-site fabrication or during
on-site construction.



 



   Inspections by Department Approved Special Activity Inspectors will be
required in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Superintendent of
Building where:



 



   1.   The structure is more than five stories or 60 feet (18,288 mm)
in height.



 



   2.   The structure exceeds 50,000 square feet (4645 m 2 ) of ground
area or 200,000 square feet (18 580 m 2 ) of total floor area.



 



   3.   Nondestructive structural testing methods are utilized.



 



   4.    The quality identification markings of the materials used are
not inspectable after installation.



 



   5.    The manner of use of materials precludes full inspection after
installation.



 



   EXCEPTION:  The Department may waive continuous or periodic inspection
required by this Section where minor quantities are involved and no unusual
hazards exist.



 



   In addition to the projects included in the above categories, the
Superintendent of Building may require Special Activity inspections if the
Superintendent of Building determines that these inspections are needed to
ensure compliance with the provisions of this Code and the work involves:



 



   6.   Unique, novel or innovative construction;



 



   7.   Highly complex or intricate construction;



 



   8.   Unique, novel or innovative grading, earth support or
foundation procedures; or



 



   9.   New methods of construction not yet provided for in the rules
and regulations.



 



      Special Activity inspection authority will be determined on a
case-by-case basis and will require Registered Deputy Inspector
registration.  The Superintendent of Building shall adopt rules and
regulations implementing the provisions of this Section.  These regulations
may establish and set the requirements for different types of Department
Approved Special Activity Inspectors.

shall be determined.  Where concrete or grout is placed by pumping through a
hollow-stem auger, the auger shall be permitted to rotate in a clockwise
direction during withdrawal.  As the auger is withdrawn at a steady rate or
in increments not to exceed 1 foot (305 mm), concreting or grouting pumping
pressures shall be measured and maintained high enough at all times to offset
hydrostatic and lateral earth pressures.  Concrete or grout volumes shall be
measured to ensure that the volume of concrete or grout placed in each
element is equal to or greater than the theoretical volume of the hole
created by the auger.  Where the installation process of any element is
interrupted or a loss of concreting or grouting pressure occurs, the element
shall be redrilled to 5 feet (1524 mm) below the elevation of the tip of the
auger when the installation was interrupted or concrete or grout pressure was
lost and reformed.  Augered cast-in-place elements shall not be installed
within six diameters center to center of an element filled with concrete or
grout less than 12 hours old, unless approved by the building official.  If
the concrete or grout level in any completed element drops due to
installation of an adjacent element, the element shall be replaced.

determination that a proposed modification is significant shall be final and
may not be appealed to the Board.



 



91.6201.6.3.3. An application for a request for significant modification
shall be made to the Board.  The applicant, in his or her request, shall
state the special, individual reason that makes compliance with the strict
letter of the provisions in question impractical and shall show that the
modification requested is in conformity with the spirit and purpose of this
division.



 



   On the date of receipt of filing of the application, the file of the
Department shall be forwarded to the Board.  Upon receipt of the
application, the Board shall set the matter for hearing and give notice by
mail not less than ten days before the hearing of the time, place and purpose
of the hearing to the applicant, to the owners of the property involved, and
to the owners of all property within or outside of the City that is within a
300-foot radius of the property on which the sign is to be placed as shown on
the records of the City Engineer, or in the case of property outside the
City, the records of the County Assessor.  (Amended by Ord. No. 181,595,

91.6201.6.4. Board Referral.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.) 
The Board may refer a request for a significant modification to the Sign
Advisory Committee (LAMC Subsection 91.105.4) for evaluation and
recommendation before it renders a decision.



 



91.6201.6.5. Fees.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.) 
Processing fees for significant modifications are the same as those set forth
for appeals to the Board in LAMC Section 98.0403.2.  Significant
modifications may also be subject to the fees set forth in LAMC Subsection
91.105.4 and LAMC Section 19.05.



 



91.6201.6.6. Purpose.  The purpose of this division is to promote public
safety and welfare by regulating signs in keeping with the following
objectives: 



 



   1.   That the design, construction, installation, repair and
maintenance of signs will not interfere with traffic safety or otherwise
endanger public safety; and



 



   2.   That both the public and sign users will benefit from signs
having improved legibility, readability and visibility.

180,446, Eff. 12/26/08.)



 



91.6205.18.1. General. (Amended by Ord. No. 183,249, Eff. 11/29/14.) All
off-site sign structures as defined in Section 14.4.2 of the LAMC and subject
to the provisions of Chapter I of the LAMC are subject to regular inspection.
Beginning February 1, 2015, the Superintendent or an authorized
representative shall inspect each sign a minimum of once every two years.



 



91.6205.18.2. Fees for Inspection. (Amended by Ord. No. 183,249, Eff.
11/29/14.) This fee shall be known as the "Off-Site Sign Periodic Inspection
Fee". The person or entity in control of an off-site sign structure subject
to inspection shall pay a regulatory fee of $169.87 to the Department and
provide a copy of a valid permit issued by the City of Los Angeles for each
off-site sign structure or a copy of a valid permit issued by the appropriate
jurisdiction if the lot was annexed to the City of Los Angeles.



 



   The regulatory fee shall be due on February 1 every two years, starting
on February 1, 2015. If the fee is not paid on or before the last day of the
month in which it is due, a monthly penalty equal to five percent of any
outstanding fee, but not less than $10.00, shall be added to the outstanding
fee each month until the outstanding fee is paid. Should the person or entity
in control fail to pay the required fee, the City of Los Angeles may recover
the fee, plus accrued penalties, utilizing any remedy approved by law.



 



   The Department shall cause all money collected pursuant to this section
to be deposited into the Off-Site Sign Periodic Inspection Fee Trust Fund
described in Section 5.111.17 of the Los Angeles Administrative Code for
purposes of disbursement as that section permits.



 



   The regulatory fee shall be used to finance the costs of administering
the inspection program, including, but not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of an off-site sign structure database. Payment of the fee shall
not create a presumption that the sign is lawfully erected, as that term is
defined in LAMC Subdivision 91.6205.18.7.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587,
Eff. 7/16/18.)



 



91.6205.18.3. Inspection Records. (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff.
7/16/18.)  The Department shall keep records of the off-site sign inspection
program, showing the following information for each off-site sign structure
subject to inspection pursuant to LAMC Subsection 91.6205.18:  the payment
of inspection fees; that inspections have been conducted; any known building
permit number; size of sign as shown on any known building permit; issuance
date of any known building permit; any subsequent building permits issued for
that sign; any information required pursuant to this division or obtained
pursuant to inspection; and whether the off-site sign structure has been
determined to be in compliance with the terms of all known building permits
and with all applicable regulations at the time the permits were issued.



 



91.6205.18.4. Frequency of Inspection. (Amended by Ord. No. 183,249, Eff.

years.



 



91.6205.18.5. (Deleted by Ord. No. 183,249, Eff. 11/29/14.)



 



91.6205.18.6. Orders.  If, upon inspection, the Superintendent or an
authorized representative observes one or more violations of the LAMC, the
Superintendent shall issue an Order to Comply.  The person in control of the
sign shall eliminate all violations by the compliance date stated on the
Order to Comply.



 



91.6205.18.7. Violations.  If the Department determines that an off-site
sign structure was not lawfully erected, then the off-site sign structure
shall have its sign face removed and replaced with blank panels until the
off-site sign structure is made to comply with the applicable provisions of
the LAMC.  The term "lawfully erected" means an off-site sign structure that
was erected in compliance with the provisions of the LAMC in effect at the
time of its erection or which was subsequently brought into full compliance
with the provisions of the LAMC, except that the term does not apply to any
off-site sign structure whose use was modified after erection in a manner
that caused it to become illegal.

complete the work and/or failure to comply with all of the conditions and
terms of the permit, the Department may order some or all of the work to be
completed to correct any hazardous conditions.  The surety executing such
bond, or such deposit, shall continue to be firmly bound under a continuing
obligation for the payment of all necessary costs and expenses that may be
incurred or expended by the city in causing any and all of such required work
to be done and that said surety or the depositor assents to any lawful
extension of time within which to construct and complete such work.  Such
costs shall include an amount equal to the cost to the city of administering
the contract and supervising the work required. In the case of a cash bond,
the deposit, or any unused portion thereof, shall be refunded to the
depositor upon completion of the work to the satisfaction of the

engineer and an engineering geologist, to the Department's satisfaction, that
the slopes will have a factor of safety against sliding of not less than 1.5
for static loads.



 



   Whenever grading at the top of any natural or manufactured slope
exposes soil or bedrock material that will allow the infiltration of water in
a manner that would adversely affect the stability of the slope, the exposed
area shall be capped with a relatively impervious compacted soil



 



blanket seal having a minimum thickness of two feet (610 mm).  The soils
engineer shall certify in writing that the blanket seal is adequate to reduce
water infiltration to permissible levels.



 



91.7010.3.  Top of Cut Slope.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff.
7/16/18.)  The top of cut slopes shall not be made nearer to a site boundary
line than 1/5 of the vertical height of cut with a minimum of 2 feet (609.8
mm) and a maximum horizontal distance of 10 feet (3048 mm).  The setback may
need to be increased for any required interceptor drains.  Setback
dimensions shall be horizontal distances measured perpendicular to the site
boundary.  Setback dimensions shall be as shown in Figure E of this division.

slope shall exceed a vertical height of 100 feet (30.48 m) unless horizontal
benches with a minimum width of 20 feet (6.096 m), as shown in Figure D of
this division are installed at each 100 feet (30.48 m) of vertical height.



 



91.7011.2.  Slope.  (Amended by Ord. No. 171,939, Eff. 4/15/98.)  No fill
shall be made which creates an exposed surface steeper than one unit vertical
in two units horizontal (50% slope).  The fill slopes abutting and above
public property shall be so placed that no portion of the fill lies above a
plane through a public property line extending upward at a slope of one unit
vertical in two units horizontal (50% slope).



 



   EXCEPTION:  The Department or the Board in case an appeal is made to
it under LAMC Section 91.105 may permit a fill to be made which creates an
exposed surface steeper in slope than 1 unit vertical in 2 units horizontal
(50% slope), provided:  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)



 



   1.   The use of the steeper slope is determined to be necessary due
to special design limitations on the site,



 



   2.   The gradient does not exceed one unit vertical in one and
one-half units horizontal (66.7% slope) and



 



   3.   The applicant shows through investigation, subsurface
exploration, analysis and report by both a soils engineer and an engineering
geologist, to the Department’s satisfaction, that the fill to be used and
the underlying bedrock or soil supporting the fill have strength
characteristics sufficient to produce a stable slope with a minimum factor of
safety not less than 1.5 for static loads.  The soils engineer shall verify
by necessary testing and observation and shall certify attainment of the
required strength characteristics in the fill materials as specified in the
approved report.



 



91.7011.3. Compaction.  (Amended by Ord. No. 180,619, Eff. 5/12/09.)  All
manufactured fills shall be placed on natural undisturbed material or
approved compacted fill.  Fills shall be compacted throughout their full
extent to a minimum relative compaction of 90 percent of maximum dry density
within 40 feet (1219 mm) below finish grade and 93 percent of maximum dry
density deeper than 40 feet (1219mm) below finish grade, unless a lower
relative compaction (not less than 90 percent of maximum dry density) is
justified by the soils engineer.  The relative compaction shall be
determined by ASTM soil compaction test D1557.  Every manufactured fill
shall be tested for relative compaction by a soil testing agency approved by
the Department.  A compaction report including a Certificate of Compliance
setting forth densities so determined shall be submitted to the Department
for review before approval of any fill is given.  For slopes to be
constructed with an exposed slope surface steeper than two horizontal to one
vertical, compaction at the exposed surface of the slope shall be obtained
either by overfilling and cutting back the slope surface until the compacted
inner core is exposed, or by compacting the outer horizontal ten feet of the
slope at least 92 percent of relative compaction.



 



   Prior to permitting building on deep fills of 40 feet or more, the
Department may require the determination of the settlement characteristics of
the fills to establish that any movements have substantially ceased.  In
those cases, a system of benchmarks shall be installed at critical points on
the fill and accurate measurement of both horizontal and vertical movements
shall be taken for a period of time sufficient to define the settlement
behavior.  In no case shall the period of time be less than one year, with
at least four consecutive checks made at intervals of three months.



 



   EXCEPTIONS:

areas where the fills are not to be used to support buildings or structures
and no hazard will be created.



 



   2.   Fill material placed in areas within cemeteries used or to be
used for internment sites shall be compacted to a minimum of 80 percent,
unless the fill is placed on a slope steeper than three horizontal to one
vertical, or placed on slopes adjacent to public properties or private
properties in separate ownership, or is to be used to support buildings or
structures, in which cases it shall be compacted to a minimum of 90 percent.



 



   3.   Compaction report is not required for gravel backfill behind

support for any structures or adverse bedding planes.



 



   Where cohesionless soil having less than 15 percent finer than 0.005
millimeters is used for fill, it shall be compacted to a minimum of 95
percent relative compaction based on maximum dry density.



 



   At cut-fill transition zones, there shall be a minimum of 3 feet (914
mm) of compacted fill at the cut pad area.  The depth of fill shall be
measured from the bottom of the deepest footings and extend horizontally
throughout the cut pad area under the building and extend a minimum of 3 feet
(914 mm) beyond exterior footings.

to determine their suitability for the proposed use before any approval to
build is issued.



 



91.7011.7.  Combined Cut and Fill Slopes.  Where a combined cut and fill
slope exceeds 25 feet (7620 mm) in height, the required drainage bench shall
be placed at the top of the cut slope.  The effect of surcharge of the fill
upon the cut bedrock shall be considered by the soils engineer and
engineering geologist, and specific recommendations shall be made relative to
the setback between the cut and fill.



 



91.7011.8.  Fill Areas.  Areas on which fill is to be placed shall be
investigated by the soils engineer, or by the soils engineer and geologist to
determine if they are adequate to support the fill without undue detrimental

91.7015.1.  General.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)  A
buttress fill is a designed compacted earth fill used for providing lateral
support to an unstabilized rock mass.  All buttress fills shall comply with
the more restrictive of the requirements of this section or LAMC Section
91.7006.



 



91.7015.2.  Foundation.  The ability of the foundation material to support
the buttress shall be investigated and the soils engineer shall provide
specifications for keying of the base of the buttress and for bonding the
buttress to the natural ground.



 



91.7015.3.  Base Width.  (Amended by Ord. No. 171,939, Eff. 4/15/98.)  The
minimum base width of a buttress fill shall not be less than 12 feet (3658
mm) or less than one half its height, whichever is the greater.  The width
of a buttress fill may vary uniformly to a top width of not less than 12 feet
(3658 mm).



 



91.7015.4.  Slope.  (Amended by Ord. No. 171,939, Eff. 4/15/98.)  The
exposed surface of a buttress fill shall not exceed a slope of one unit
vertical in two units horizontal (50% slope).



 



   EXCEPTION:  The Department or the Board, in case an appeal is made to
it under LAMC Section 91.105, may permit a buttress fill to be made which
creates an exposed surface steeper in slope than 1 unit vertical in 2 units
horizontal (50% slope), provided:  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff.
7/16/18.)



 



   1.   The use of the steeper slope is determined to be necessary due
to special design limitations on the site;



 



   2.   The gradient does not exceed one unit vertical in one and
one-half units horizontal (66.7% slope); and



 



   3.   The applicant shows through investigation, subsurface
exploration, analysis and report by both a soils engineer and an engineering
geologist to the Department’s satisfaction, that the buttress fill to be
used and the underlying earth material supporting the fill will have strength
characteristics sufficient to produce a stable slope with a minimum factor of
safety of not less than 1.5 for static loads.



 



91.7015.5.  Subdrains.  Subdrains which blanket the entire back face of the
buttress or which occur at intervals shall be provided to prevent buildup of
hydrostatic pressure.  Details of subdrains shall be provided by the soils
engineer and approved by the Department.



 



91.7015.6.  Blanket Seals.  (Amended by Ord. No. 171,939, Eff. 4/15/98.) 
Blanket seals of relatively impervious material shall be required on cut pads
above buttress fills where grading exposes the strata to infiltration of
water.  The blanket shall be of 2-foot (610 mm) minimum thickness or of such
greater dimension as specified by the soils engineer.



 



91.7015.7.  Design.  (Amended by Ord. No. 179,324, Eff. 12/10/07, Oper.
1/1/08.)  For design purposes, a maximum value of 75 pound per square feet
(3.6 kN/m2) cohesion and an angle of internal friction of six degrees may be
used to determine the resistance of the bedding plane.  Use of greater value
shall be substantiated by tests taken along the probable slip plane under
conditions simulating the worst possible field conditions.  The method of
performing these tests shall be included in the soils engineer's report.



 



   The type, percentage of compaction, cohesion and angle of internal
friction of the materials to be placed in the buttress shall be specified.



 



   The buttress fill shall be designed for a minimum safety factor of 1.50
based on the residual strength of the bedrock and the lowest shear strength
of the fill material.

premises in the event the person notified is not the owner, or any person
representing the owner who attends the hearing, shall be given an opportunity

additional requirements should be imposed.  The Board shall proceed with the
hearing whether or not that person is in attendance.  Written material shall
be considered by the Board if it is received at least three days prior to the
scheduled hearing date.

welfare.  The owner and any other person who appeared at the scheduled
public hearing on behalf of the owner, either in person or by the submission
of written material, shall be notified in writing of the determination of the
Board.  Once the Board has acted, it shall have no further jurisdiction over

disk, 6 inches in diameter on a 12 inch by 12 inch (304.8 mm x 304.8 mm)
white tile, placed at the bottom of the pool at its deepest point, shall be

following provisions shall apply in addition to the provisions of Title 24,
Part 8 of the California Code of Regulations, the State Historical Building
Code.

91.8119.4.  Preservation of Historical Buildings.



 



91.8119.4.1.  If the Department determines that any building, structure,
premises or portion thereof, (1) has been designated an historical monument
or (2) is being considered as a historical monument by the Cultural Heritage
Commission, and (3) is subject to vandalism, or unlawful entry, or has become
a hazardous building, nuisance or substandard building, then the Department
may cause the building, structure, or premises or any portion thereof, to be
immediately barricaded and protected by such means as the Department may deem
advisable, including the use of a Department awarded contract.



 



91.8119.4.2.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)  The Department
may cause the building, structure or premises, or any portion of the
building, structure or premises, to be immediately barricaded or protected
from further deterioration.  The barricading or protection may be
accomplished by any City department with the forces to perform the work, upon
receipt of a request from the Department, or by any forces under contract to
the City. Where the work is accomplished by other than City forces, the cost
shall be paid from the "Repair and Demolition Fund" as established in LAMC
Section 91.8906.  All costs incurred pursuant to this section shall be a
personal obligation against the owner of the property upon which the
particular building or structure or any portion is located, recoverable by
the City in an action before any court of competent jurisdiction.  These
costs shall include an amount equal to 40 percent of the cost to perform the
actual work, but not less than the sum of $100.00, to cover the City’s
costs for administering any contract and supervising the work required.  In
addition to this personal obligation and all other remedies provided by law,
the City may collect any judgment, fee, cost, or charge, including any permit
fees, fines, late charges, or interest, incurred in relation to the
provisions of this section as provided in Los Angeles Administrative Code
Sections 7.35.1 through 7.35.8.



 



91.8119.4.3.  The administrative fee of 40 percent of the costs shall not be
included in the calculation of costs incurred for or arising out of any
barricading, or protecting, resulting from an event or course of events that
prompted a declaration of a state of emergency, local emergency, war
emergency or major disaster by the Mayor, the Governor of the State, or by
the President of the United States.  (Amended by Ord. No. 175,596, Eff.
12/7/03.)



 



91.8119.4.4.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)  If the
Department determines that the building, structure, or premises or portion
thereof is not in danger of imminent deterioration or vandalism, then the
Department may, in lieu of the above, require the building, structure or
premises or any portion thereof to be secured, repaired or protected pursuant
to the provisions of Division 89, Article 1, Chapter IX of the LAMC.



 



91.8119.5.  Vandalism of Historical Buildings.  The Department shall have
the authority to issue an Order to Comply to an owner of any building that
has been designated an historical monument or is being considered as an
historical monument by the Cultural Heritage Commission if the Department
determines that the building has become subject to vandalism or constitutes a
public nuisance.  In such circumstances, the Department shall have the
authority to issue any order it deems appropriate to keep the property from
being further vandalized or from becoming a public nuisance including, but
not limited to, ordering that the building be secured and fenced.



 



   For the purposes of this provision, any building which has been
designated an historical monument or is being considered as an historical
monument by the Cultural Heritage Commission shall include the interiors and
exteriors of any accessory building located on an historic site.



 



91.8119.5.1.  Security measures that the Department may order shall include,
but not be limited to, the following:



 



   1.   The installation of the maximum allowed height under this Code
of chain- link perimeter fencing with top mounted horizontal pipe and razor
wire, and at least one securely-locked pedestrian gate and the posting of
“NO TRESPASSING” signs, pursuant to Section 41.24 of the Los Angeles
Municipal Code, at 25-foot intervals.



 



   2.   Steel or plywood closures, with one-inch diameter air holes,
installed at all doors and windows.  (Sandwich panel installation shall be
used so as to avoid drilling into window frames and sashes, doors, ornament
or masonry units.)



 



   3.   The removal of all debris from the premises, including but not
limited to wood, paper, cans, bottles and fecal matter.



 



   Any temporary modifications required to be made to secure the building
shall be reversible.



 



91.8119.5.2.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)  Any plans or
proposals for work required to be performed pursuant to an Order to Comply to
secure any building from being further vandalized or from becoming a public
nuisance must first be reviewed by the Cultural Affairs Department to ensure
that any work done to secure the building will not damage or alter the
historic character of the building.  This review by the Cultural Affairs
Department must be completed within ten working days from the date any
request for review is submitted.  The Cultural Affairs Department shall only
disapprove a plan or proposal to secure a building if the work will
significantly damage or alter the historic character of the building.  If
the work to be performed includes substantial alteration, the procedures set
forth in Los Angeles Administrative Code Section 22.171.12 shall be utilized
for review by the Cultural Affairs Department.



 



   Failure to act upon a request for review within the time periods set
forth herein shall constitute a waiver by the Cultural Affairs Department of
the right to review plans or proposals for the work to be performed.  Work
ordered to be performed immediately pursuant to an Order to Comply, as
determined by the Department of Building and Safety, may be commenced and
completed without prior review by the Cultural Affairs Department.



 



   Nothing herein shall be interpreted to prohibit an owner from taking
immediate temporary measures to secure a building from unauthorized entry.



 



91.8119.5.3.  91.8119.5.3.(Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)  It
shall be unlawful for any property owner to fail to comply with any Order to
Comply issued by the Department under this provision and every failure shall
be punishable as a misdemeanor.



 



91.8119.5.4.  Additional Remedies – Notice Of Intention.  (Amended by
Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)  In addition to the remedies provided by
this Code, should an owner fail to comply with an Order to Comply, the
Department may take the necessary measures, including those authorized under
LAMC Sections 91.8903, 91.8904 and 91.8905, to immediately secure the
property against vandalism or prevent it from becoming a public nuisance. 
Prior to taking these measures, the Department shall send a Notice of
Intention to the owner pursuant to the provisions set forth in LAMC
Subdivisions 91.8903.3.3 and 91.8903.3.4.



 



   Except for measures taken pursuant to LAMC Section 91.8905, when a
Notice of Intention is issued under this section, the provisions of LAMC
Subdivision 91.8903.3.5, through and including Subdivision 91.8903.4.3, shall
also apply.



 



   This provision is in addition to the remedies provided in LAMC Sections
91.8903, 91.8904, and 91.8905.



 



   All costs incurred pursuant to this section shall be a personal
obligation against the owner of the property, recoverable by the City in an
action before any court of competent jurisdiction.  These costs shall
include an amount equal to 40% of the cost to perform the actual work, but
not less than the sum of $100.00, to cover the City's costs for administering
any contract and supervising the work required.  In addition to this
personal obligation and all other remedies provided by law, the City may
collect any judgment, fee, cost, or charge, including any permit fees, fines,
late charges, or interest, incurred in relation to the provisions of this
section as provided in Los Angeles Administrative Code Sections 7.35.1
through 7.35.8.

classification and the building meets or is altered to meet the other
requirements of this Code for the use or occupancy change.

or not any alterations to the building are required by this Code.  For the
purpose of this division, the occupancy group and division of interconnected
assembly rooms shall be based on the total occupant load in such rooms.



 



   If the building or portion thereof does not conform to the requirements
of this Code for the proposed occupancy group or division, the building or
portion thereof shall be made to conform.  The Department may issue a new
Certificate of Occupancy without stating therein that all of the requirements
of the Code have been met and without requiring compliance with all such
requirements if it is found that the change in occupancy group or division
will result in no overall increase in hazard to life, limb, health, property
or public welfare.

   No change shall be made in the character of occupancies or use of any
building that would place the building in a different division of the same
group of occupancy or in a different group of occupancies, unless such
building is made to comply with the requirements of this code for such
division or group of occupancy.  (Amended by Ord. No. 180,619, Eff. 5/12/09.)

established by the Department will not result in an overall increase in
hazard to life, limb, health, property or public welfare.

91.8303.2.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)  Each such
application shall be signed by the person owning or having legal control of
the site upon which the building or structure is to be relocated, and prior
to any appeal or the issuance of any permit there shall be filed fully
delineated working drawings, electrical and mechanical plans and complete
specifications.  Such working drawings, plans and specifications shall show
all new construction, materials, fixtures and fittings and any alterations,
repairs or additions to be made to existing construction.  Such plans shall
also include floor plans, elevations and necessary construction details so as
to show conformity with the intent of this section.  Such drawings, plans
and specifications shall, in addition to the requirements of LAMC Subdivision
91.106.3.3, show all site preparation, grading and improvements.



 



   The applicant shall assume all responsibility for the preparation and
completeness of said plans.  In the event the City elects to complete the
building or to demolish the building under the provisions of the Municipal
Code, the City reserves the right to interpret errors or omissions or supply
missing information on the plans.  The City shall not be responsible for the
performance of the work done under any contract entered into to complete or
demolish the building.



 



91.8303.3.  Any lot within the City from which a building or structure is
moved shall be cleared of all debris resulting from such removal.  The

graded as necessary to provide drainage to a street, gutter or other approved
location.  A demolition permit shall be secured by the owner to authorize
this work.



 



 



SEC. 91.8304.  SPECIAL CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH A PERMIT WILL NOT BE ISSUED.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 171,175, Eff. 7/25/96.)



 



   No permit shall be issued to relocate any building or structure, if any
one of the following conditions exist:



 



   1.   It is unfit for human habitation or is so dilapidated,
defective or in such condition of deterioration or disrepair that its
relocation at the proposed site would cause appreciable harm or be materially
detrimental to the property or improvements in the neighborhood within a
radius of 1,000 feet from the proposed site.



 



   2.   Because of age, size, design, architectural treatment or
proposed location on the lot, the building does not substantially conform to
the general design, plan, location on the lot and construction of the
buildings located in the neighborhood within a radius of 1,000 feet from the
proposed site so that its relocation would be materially detrimental to the
property or improvements in said neighborhood.



 



   3.   The proposed use is prohibited by the zoning laws of the City.



 



   4.   Whenever the applicant is currently in default, as determined
by the Department, on one or more Relocation Permits.



 



 



SEC. 91.8305.  GUARANTEE OF COMPLETION REQUIRED.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 171,175, Eff. 7/25/96.)



 



91.8305.1.  Relocation Permit.  No relocation permit shall be issued unless
the applicant therefore shall first post with the Department of Building and
Safety a bond in an amount equal to the cost of the work required to be done,
plus an additional 25 percent, guaranteeing compliance with all conditions of
the permit and completion of all work described in the plans and
specifications therefor, as estimated by the Department of Building and
Safety.  The applicant may post either a surety bond or cash bond or
negotiable United States Treasury Certificates of the kind approved by law
for securing deposits of public money.



 



   The bond shall be executed by the applicant as principal and, if a
surety bond, shall also be executed by a corporation authorized to act as
surety under the laws of the state of California.  The bond shall be a joint
and several obligation and shall be conditioned upon the faithful performance
of all terms and conditions of the permit and of all work described in the
plans and specifications therefor to the satisfaction of the Department of
Building and Safety.  The bond shall contain the further conditions that
should the applicant fail to complete all such work within the time specified
on the permit, the City may, at its option, cause all of such work to be done
or completed in accordance with the terms and conditions of the permits and
the plans and specifications therefor on file with said Department, or
demolish the building.



 



   The parties executing the bond shall be firmly and continuously bound
for the payment of all the costs necessary to complete the work or demolish
the building under all terms and conditions of the bond.  The cost shall
include the cost to complete the work or demolish the building, including any
cost to monitor or remove asbestos, plus an amount equal to 40 percent of the
cost to cover the cost to the City of administering the contract and
supervising the work required.  (Amended by Ord. No. 175,596, Eff. 12/7/03.)



 



   Whenever the applicant elects to deposit cash or approved negotiable
United States Treasury Certificates, the City shall be authorized in the
event of any default on the part of the applicant to use any or all of the
cash or approved negotiable certificates to cause the work to be done and for
the payment of all costs thereof.  The term of the bond shall begin on the
date of the deposit of the cash or negotiable certificates or the filing of
the surety bond, and shall end upon the date of the completion to the
satisfaction of the Department of all such work.  The fact of such
completion shall be evidenced by a written statement thereof signed by the
Superintendent of Building and thereafter the cash deposit or certificate
shall be returned to the applicant, or the surety bond released, as the case
may be.



 



   Whenever the City elects to have such work done because of the
applicant’s default, the amount of the deposit or certificates in excess of
all cost of such work shall be returned to the applicant after the work has
been so approved.



 



   EXCEPTION:  No bond need be posted in any case where the Department
shall determine that the only relocation involved is that of moving a
building temporarily to the regularly occupied business premises of a house
mover, or that of moving a building to adjacent property of the same owner. 
The exceptions herein made shall not apply unless the Department further
finds that no such security is necessary in order to assure compliance with
the requirements of this section.



 



91.8305.2.  Security Deposit.  No House Mover’s Permit shall be issued to
any house mover pursuant to the terms of the Los Angeles Municipal Code,
Sections 62.62 to 62.93, inclusive, until the applicant therefor shall have
deposited with the Department of Building and Safety a security deposit of
$2.00 per square foot of total floor area of all buildings, as stated in the
application provided for in Subsection A of Section 62.84 of the Los Angeles
Municipal Code.



 



   In lieu of the specific deposit for each application, any house mover
may make and maintain a general deposit in the sum of $3,000.00 which shall
be used for the same purposes as the specific deposit mentioned in this
section.



 



   If, for any reason, the move as authorized by the House Mover’s
Permit is not completed within 30 days of the date of issuance and it becomes
necessary for the Department of Building and Safety to either remove or
demolish the building or structure, the cost of so doing plus an
administrative fee of 40 percent shall be deducted from the aforementioned
deposit.  The remainder of such deposit, if any, shall be refunded to the
person making such deposit, or to his or her assigns.



 



   In case the deposit shall not be sufficient to pay the cost of removal
or demolition, or of the costs of repairs, if any, the person making such
deposit shall, upon demand, pay to the Department of Building and Safety a
sufficient sum to cover all such cost.  Upon failure to pay such sum, it may
be recovered by the City in any court of competent jurisdiction.

   Every relocation permit issued under the provisions of this section
shall contain each and every term ad condition imposed by the Department of
Building and Safety; shall be valid for a period not to exceed 120 days,
unless extended by said Department or by the Board, in case an appeal is made
to it under Section 98.0403.2 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code, and shall
become null and void without further notice or order upon the expiration of
such time or any extension thereof, or upon any default in the performance of
any of the aforesaid terms or conditions.

   1.   A building has not been lowered onto its foundation within 60
days after issuance of the relocation permit; or



 



   2.   A default has occurred in the performance of any term or
condition of the relocation permit; or



 



   3.   The applicant has failed to complete the work required as
specified by the permit, plans and/or specifications approved for the project
within the time prescribed, the Department shall be authorized to give notice
to the applicant and to the surety, if any, to complete the work or perform
the condition within a specified additional time, not to exceed 60 days. 
Such notice shall be served upon the applicant and the surety, if any, by
certified mail, and shall be deemed to have been so served when placed in the

shall fail or refuse to comply with such notice.  However, such notice may
be complied with by demolishing and removing the building or structure and
restoring the site within the time prescribed, at the option of the applicant
or the surety, as the case may be.



 



91.8307.2.  If the applicant or the surety fails or refuses to comply with
any notice within the time prescribed, the Department shall be authorized to
cause the building or structure to be demolished or the work to be completed,
whichever it shall determine is reasonable under the circumstances, without
further notice or order.  The cost of completing the work or demolishing the
building, including the cost of any monitoring or removal of asbestos, plus
the 40 percent administration and supervision cost, shall be paid for out of
the cash deposit or negotiable United States Treasury Certificates posted
with the Department, or from the Repair and Demolition Fund, if no deposit or
certificate has been posted.  All sums used for this purposes out of the
Repair and Demolition Fund shall be recovered from the surety under the
surety bond provided for above.  Any work to be performed by the Department
under the provisions of this section shall be done in accordance with the
established public works practices of the City of Los Angeles.  If the
Department uses any money in the Repair and Demolition Fund for the
completion or demolition of any building under the provisions of this
section, the Department shall notify the surety, and the surety shall
immediately thereafter reimburse the City of Los Angeles therefor under the
surety bond.  The City Attorney is authorized to and shall institute any
action necessary to the recovery of the money under the surety bond provided
for above.  (Amended by Ord. No. 175,596, Eff. 12/7/03.)

of $300.00 for each such amended application will be charged.  If a

purpose of this division is to provide alternative building standards for the
conversion of Existing Buildings, or portions thereof, from commercial or
industrial uses to Joint Living and Work Quarters.  The alternative
standards are designed to provide a reasonable level of safety to the
building occupants and are in conformance with the provisions of California
Health and Safety Code Section 17958.11.



 



91.8501.2.  Application.  (Amended by Ord. No. 181,133, Eff. 5/11/10.) 
Nothing in this division shall be construed to allow the reduction of the
seismic or fire and life safety elements of an Existing Building, where such
elements provide a greater level of protection than the minimum requirements
established by this division.



 



   The alternative building standards of this division may be applied when
the commercial or industrial uses in an Existing Building are converted
(change of use or occupancy) to Joint Living and Work Quarters provided:



 



   A.   General Fire and Life Safety Requirements for All Existing

area, height, number of stories, type of construction, occupancy, means of
egress and other fire and life safety requirements of this code for a new
building of the same use or occupancy, except as provided in this division.



 



   B.   Structural Requirements for all Existing Buildings.  For all
existing buildings, the change of occupancy or use of any portion of an
Existing Building to a Joint Living and Work Quarters may be permitted
provided the entire building complies or is made to comply with all the
structural requirements in LAMC Subsection 91.8502.12.  (Amended by Ord. No.
185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)

inspection that a building does not conform to the minimum requirements of
LAMC Subsection 91.8604.6, it shall prepare a written Fire/Life Safety Order
directing the owner to repair and modify the building so as to conform to the

requirements in the occupied portions of the building within the time
guidelines of their plan of action, unless to do so poses a threat of health
or safety.



 



   4.   ASBESTOS. If an owner of a building commits to a program of
abatement of asbestos, then the Department may grant an extension of time to

pumps, riser and all sprinkler riser valves for sprinkler connections on each
floor are installed and operational prior to the grant of any extension.



 



   Subsequent extension approvals beyond the initial approval shall also
be conditioned on progress of work in conformance with the plan of work
submitted with the approved extension of time.



 



   A request for an extension of time under Exceptions 1-4 above shall be
filed on an application form provided by the Department and signed by the
owner of the building.  Applications are subject to review and action by the
Department with concurrence by the Fire Department.  An extension of time

SEC. 91.8801.  PURPOSE.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 171,939, Eff. 4/15/98.)



 



   The purpose of this division is to promote public safety and welfare by
reducing the risk of death or injury that may result from the effects of
earthquakes on unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings constructed before
1934. Such buildings have been widely recognized for their sustaining of life
hazardous damage as a result of partial or complete collapse during past
moderate to strong earthquakes.



 



   The provisions of this division are minimum standards for structural
seismic resistance established primarily to reduce the risk of loss of life
or injury and will not necessarily prevent loss of life or injury or prevent
earthquake damage to an existing building which complies with these
standards. This division shall not require existing electrical, plumbing,
mechanical or fire-safety systems to be altered unless they constitute a
hazard to life or property.



 



   This division provides systematic procedures and standards for
identification and classification of unreinforced masonry bearing wall
buildings based on their current use. Priorities, time periods and standards
are also established under which these buildings are required to be
structurally analyzed and anchored. Where the analysis determines
deficiencies, this division requires the building to be strengthened or
demolished.



 



 



SEC. 91.8802.  SCOPE.



 



   The provisions of this division shall apply to all buildings
constructed or under construction prior to October 6, 1933, or for which a
building permit was issued prior to October 6, 1933, which on the effective
date of this ordinance have unreinforced masonry bearing walls as defined
herein.



 



   EXCEPTION:  This division shall not apply to detached one- or
two-family dwellings and detached apartment houses containing less than 5
dwelling units and used solely for residential purposes.



 



 



SEC. 91.8803.  DEFINITIONS.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 179,324, Eff. 12/10/07, Oper. 1/1/08.)



 



   For purposes of this division, the applicable definitions in CBC
Sections 1602 and 1613 and the following shall apply:



 



   ESSENTIAL BUILDING is any building housing a hospital or other medical
facility having surgery or emergency treatment areas, fire or police
stations, municipal government disaster operation and communication centers.

walls or wood-frame cross walls spaced less than 40 feet (12 192 mm) apart in
each story. Cross walls shall be full-story height with a minimum length of 1
1/2 times the story height.



 



   2.   Any building used for its intended purpose, as determined by
the Department, for less than 20 hours per week.



 



   HISTORICAL BUILDING is any building designated as an historical
building by an appropriate federal, state or City jurisdiction.



 



   LOW-RISK BUILDING is any building not classified as an essential
building having an occupant load as determined by CBC Section 1004.1 of less
than 20 occupants.



 



   MEDIUM-RISK BUILDING is any building not classified as a high-risk
building or an essential building having an occupant load as determined by
CBC Section 1004.1 of 20 occupants or more.



 



   UNREINFORCED MASONRY BEARING WALL is a masonry wall having all the
following characteristics:



 



   1.   Provides the vertical support for a floor or roof.



 



   2.   The total superimposed load is over 100 pounds per linear foot

   The rating classifications as exhibited in Table No. 88-A are hereby
established and each building within the scope of this division shall be
placed in one rating classification by the Department.  The total occupant
load of the entire building as determined by CBC Section 1004.1 shall be used
to determine the rating classification.



 



   EXCEPTIONS:



 



   1.   For the purpose of this division, portions of buildings
constructed to act independently when resisting seismic forces may be placed
in separate rating classifications.



 



   2.   For the purpose of this division, to establish the rating
classification of a building containing one or more artist in residence
spaces, as defined in Section 91.8501 of this Code, the occupant load of each
artist in residence space shall be one for each space less than 2,000 square
feet (186 m2) in area and two for each space 2,000 square feet (186 m2) or
more in area.

91.8809.5.1.  General Provisions.  (Amended by Ord. No. 171,939, Eff.
4/15/98.)  All unreinforced masonry walls utilized to carry vertical loads
and seismic forces parallel and perpendicular to the wall plane shall be
tested as specified in this section.  All masonry quality shall equal or
exceed the minimum standards established herein or shall be removed and
replaced by new materials. Alternate methods of testing may be approved by
the Department.  The quality of mortar in all masonry walls shall be
determined by performing in-place shear tests or by testing eight-inch (203
mm) diameter cores.



 



   The vertical wall joint between wythes (collar joints) shall be
inspected at the test location after the in-place shear tests, and an
estimate of the percentage of wythe-to-wythe mortar coverage shall be
reported along with the results of the in-place shear tests.  Where the
exterior face is veneer, the type of veneer, its thickness and its bonding
and/or ties to the structural wall masonry shall also be reported.



 



   Alternative methods of testing may be approved by the Department. 
Nothing shall prevent pointing with mortar of all the masonry wall joints
before the tests are first made.  Prior to any pointing, the mortar joints
must be raked and cleaned to remove loose and deteriorated mortar.  Mortar
for pointing shall be Type S or N except masonry cements shall not be used. 
All preparation and mortar pointing shall be done under the continuous
inspection of a registered deputy inspector.  At the conclusion of the
inspection, the inspector shall submit a written report to the licensed

submitted to the Department for approval as part of the structural analysis.



 



   All testing shall meet Department-approved testing method parameters
(including rate of load application) and shall be performed in accordance
with the requirements specified in this section by a testing agency approved
by the Department.



 



   An accurate record of all such tests and their location in the building
shall be recorded and these results shall be submitted to the Department for
approval as part of the structural analysis.



 



91.8809.5.2.  Number and Location of Tests.  (Amended by Ord. No. 171,939,

   1.   At each of both the first and top stories, not less than two
per wall line or line of wall elements providing a common line of resistance
to lateral forces.



 



   2.   At each of all other stories, not less than one per wall
element providing a common line of resistance to lateral forces.



 



   3.   In any case, not less than one per 1,500 square feet (139.4 m 2
) of wall surface and a total of eight.



 



   The shear tests shall be taken at locations representative of the
mortar conditions throughout the entire building, taking into account
variations in workmanship at different building height levels, variations in
weathering of the exterior surfaces and variations in the condition of the
interior surfaces due to deterioration caused by leaks and condensation of
water and/or by the deleterious effects of other substances contained within
the building.  Where the higher h/t ratios allowed in Footnotes Nos. 4 and 5
of Table No. 88-G are to be used, the in-place shear tests taken at the top
story shall be included in the 80 percent of the shear tests used to
determine the minimum mortar shear strength.



 



   The exact test or core location shall be determined at the building
site by the licensed engineer or architect responsible for the seismic
analysis of the subject building.

8/8/11.)  The bed joints of the outer wythe of the masonry shall be tested
in shear by laterally displacing a single brick relative to the adjacent
bricks in that wythe.  The mortar in the opposite head joint of the brick to
be tested shall be removed and cleaned prior to testing.  The minimum
quality mortar in 80 percent of the shear tests shall not be less than the
total of 30 psi (206.9 kPa) plus the axial stress in the wall at the point of
the test.  The shear stress shall be based on the gross area of both bed
joints and shall be that shear stress at which movement of the masonry is
first measured or at which cracking first appears.



 



   An internal caliper, graduated in 0.001 of an inch (0.025 mm)
increments shall be used to measure movement of the masonry unit.  A
hydraulic jack equipped with a pressure gauge graduated in increments of 50
psi (345 kPa) or less shall be used.  The jack load shall be applied at a
rate not exceeding 5,000 pounds (22 240 N) per minute.



 



   The test shall be conducted by a minimum of two technicians.  Load and
displacement readings shall be recorded at the following intervals:



 



   1.   At a caliper reading of 0.001 inch (0.025 mm);



 



   2.   At first visually observed sign of movement or cracking of the
mortar or masonry unit;



 



   3.   At a caliper reading of 0.02 inch (0.51 mm); and



 



   4.   The ultimate load on the unit.



 



   The masonry unit to be tested shall not be located adjacent to a bond
course in a brick wall laid in common bond.  Tests to evaluate the mortar
quality of structural walls shall not be conducted in masonry veneer.



 



   Walls with mortar values which are consistently low and do not meet the
minimum quality values specified in this Section shall be entirely pointed
per Chapter A1, Section A103 and A106.3.3.9 of 2007 California Existing
Building Code except that the depth of joint penetration shall be 1-l/2 inch
(38 mm) in lieu of the 3/4 inch (19 mm) specified.



 



91.8809.5.4.  Core Tests.  (Amended by Ord. No. 171,939, Eff. 4/15/98.)  A
minimum number of mortar test specimens equal to the number of required cores
shall be prepared from the cores and tested as specified herein.  The mortar
joint of the outer wythe of the masonry core shall be tested in shear by
placing the circular core section in a compression testing machine with the
mortar bed joint rotated 15 degrees from the axis of the applied load.  The
mortar joint tested in shear shall have an average ultimate stress of 20 psi
(138 kPa) based on the gross area.  The average shall be obtained from the
total number of cores made.  If test specimens cannot be made from cores
taken, the shear value shall be reported as zero.

   1/2-inch-diameter bolts or dowels – 40 foot-pounds.



 



   5/8-inch-diameter bolts or dowels – 50 foot-pounds.



 



   3/4-inch-diameter bolts or dowels – 60 foot-pounds.



 



   For SI: 1 inch = 25.4 mm, 1 foot-pound = 1.356 Nm



 



   No bolts exceeding 3/4-inch (19.1 mm) shall be used.  All nuts shall
be installed over malleable iron or plate washers when bearing on wood and

number tested shall be four per floor, with two tests at walls with joists
framing into the wall and two tests at walls with joists parallel to the
wall.  The test apparatus shall be supported on the masonry wall at a
minimum distance of the wall thickness from the anchor tested.  The rod
anchor shall be given a preload of 300 pounds (136 kg) prior to establishing
a datum for recording elongation.  The tension test load reported shall be
recorded at 1/8–inch (3.2 mm) relative movement of the anchor and the
adjacent masonry surface. Results of all tests shall be reported.  The
report shall include the test results as related to the wall thickness and

   EXCEPTION:  Walls need not be anchored to ceiling systems that,
because of their low mass and/or relative location with respect to the floor
or roof systems, would not impose significant normal forces on the wall and
cause out-of-plane wall failures.



 



   At the roof and all floor levels, the anchors nearest the building
corners shall be combination shear and tension anchors located not more than
two feet (610 mm) horizontally from the inside corners of the walls.



 



   When access to the exterior face of the masonry wall is prevented by
proximity of an existing building, wall anchors conforming to Items 5 and 7
in Table No. 88-I may be used.



 



   Alternative devices to be used in lieu of tension bolts for masonry
wall anchorage shall be tested as specified in Section 91.8809.9.

SEC. 91.8811.  DESIGN CHECK – COMPATIBILITY OF ROOF DIAPHRAGM STIFFNESS TO
UNREINFORCED MASONRY WALL OUT-OF-PLANE STABILITY.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 171,175, Eff. 7/25/96.)



 



91.8811.1.  General.  (Amended by Ord. No. 171,939, Eff. 4/15/98.)  The
requirements of this section are in addition to the requirements of Sections
91.8808 and 91.8809.  The relative stiffness and strength of a diaphragm
governs the amount of amplification of the seismic ground motion by the
diaphragm and, therefore, a diaphragm stiffness and strength-related check of
the out-of-plane stability of unreinforced masonry walls anchored to wood
diaphragms shall be made.  This section contains a procedure for the
evaluation of the out-of-plane stability of unreinforced masonry walls
anchored to wood diaphragms that are coupled to shear-resisting elements.



 



91.8811.2.  Requirements for Terms.  (Amended by Ord. No. 179,324, Eff.
12/10/07, Oper. 1/1/08.)  The requirements for the terms used in this
Division shall be defined as follows:



 



   CROSS WALL is a wood-framed wall having a height-to-length ratio of:



 



   1.   Two to one for wood structural panels.



 



   2.   One to one for gypsum board, gypsum lath, cement plaster or
diagonal sheathing.



 



   The total strength of all cross walls located within any 40-foot (12
192 mm) length of diaphragm measured in the direction of the diaphragm span
shall not be less than 30 percent of the strength of the diaphragm in the
direction of consideration.



 



   DEMAND-CAPACITY RATIO (DCR) is a ratio of the following:



 



   1.   Demand = lateral forces due to 33 percent of the weight of the
diaphragm and the tributary weight of the walls and other elements anchored
to the diaphragm.



 



   2.   Capacity = diaphragm total shear strength in the direction
under consideration as determined using the values in Table No. 88-K or Table
No. 88-L.



 



91.8811.3.  Notations.  (Amended by Ord. No. 171,939, Eff. 4/15/98.)



 



   D   =   depth of diaphragm, in feet (mm), measured perpendicular
to the diaphragm span.



 



   h/t   =   height-to-thickness ratio of an unreinforced masonry
wall. The height shall be measured between wall anchorage levels and the
thickness shall be measured through the wall cross section.



 



   L   =   span of diaphragm between masonry shear walls or steel
frames.



 



   Vc   =   total shear capacity of cross walls in the direction of
analysis immediately below the diaphragm level being investigated as
determined by using Tables Nos. 88-K and 88-L.



 



   vu   =   maximum shear strength in pounds per foot for a
diaphragm sheathed with any of the materials given in Tables Nos. 88-K and
88-L.



 



   Wd   =   total dead load of the diaphragm plus the tributary
weight of the walls anchored to the diaphragm, the tributary ceiling and
partitions and the weight of any other permanent building elements at the
diaphragm level under investigation.



 



91.8811.4.  Design Check Procedure.  (Added by Ord. No. 171,939, Eff.
4/15/98.)



 



91.8811.4.1.  General.  The demand-capacity ratio (DCR) for the building
under investigation shall be calculated using the following equations:



 




   DCR = 0.33Wd /2vuD   (11-3)




 



   or



 




   DCR = 0.33Wd /(2vuD + Vc)   (11-4)




 



91.8811.4.2.  Diaphragm Deflection.  The calculated DCR shall be to the
left of the curve in Figure No. 88-A.  Where the calculated DCR is outside
(to the right of) the curve, the diaphragm deflection limits are exceeded,
and cross walls may be used to reduce the deflection.



 



91.8811.4.3.  Unreinforced Masonry Wall Out-of-Plane Stability.  The DCR
shall be calculated discounting any cross walls.  If the DCR corresponding
to the diaphragm span is to the right of the curve in Figure No. 88-A, the
region within the curve at and below the intersection of the diaphragm span
with the curve may be used to determine the allowable h/t values per Table
No. 88-G.



 



 



SEC. 91.8812.  VIOLATIONS.

91.8903.6.  Failure to Pay Charges.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff.
7/16/18.)  Should the owner or other party of interest fail to pay, within
30 days after billing, any charge imposed upon such party pursuant to LAMC
Subdivision 91.8903.5.2 or 91.8903.5.3, the Department shall transmit any
unpaid claim to the Office of the City Attorney for collection and/or
appropriate legal remedy as determined by the Office of the City Attorney.



 



91.8903.7.  Appeals and Hearings.



 



91.8903.7.1.  Appeals.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)  Upon
written application by an interested party within 30 days from the service of
the initial order as provided for in LAMC Subsection 91.8903.1, for good
cause shown and where no imminent risk of life or property is present, the
Department or the Board, in case an appeal is made to it pursuant to LAMC
Section 98.0403.2, may grant a reasonable extension of time, not to exceed
120 days after expiration of the 30 day period provided for in the initial
order, within which the work required must be commenced.



 



   Nothing in this subdivision precludes the Board from establishing a
policy of granting less than the maximum time to comply with Department
orders.



 



91.8903.7.2.  Hearings.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)



 



   A.   Upon the issuance of a Notice of Intention, as provided for in
LAMC Subsection 91.8903.3, any owner or party of interest may appeal in
writing to the Board for a hearing to determine the condition of the
property, whether it falls within the scope of this division, whether it
should be repaired or demolished, and how much time should be given to
complete the required work.  The request for the hearing shall be made prior
to the date set to solicit bids or execute a work order as specified in the
Notice of Intention.  A request after such date may not be accepted for
processing unless it is submitted prior to the Department's awarding a
contract or issuing a work order and it is authorized by the Board.  Failure
of the owner or any party of interest in the property to request a hearing
within the specified time or failure to pay the required filing fees shall be
deemed a waiver of request for such a hearing.



 



   B.   At the hearing the Department shall submit for the record
evidence to show whether or not the building or structure falls within the
scope of this division.  The evidence shall consist of, but need not be
limited to, the inspection report originally issued by the Department
pursuant to LAMC Subsection 91.8903.1, recent pictures, and testimony by a
representative of the Department.  The owner or any party of interest shall
have the opportunity prior to the hearing to examine the evidence to be
submitted by the Department.  The owner, the owner's representative or
counsel, or a party of interest should be present at the hearing and will be
given the opportunity to present any relevant evidence or witnesses,
cross-examine any Department witnesses and ask questions or make comments
concerning the Department's evidence and testimony. Failure of the owner or
the owner's representative to appear at the hearing after receiving notice of
the hearing shall be deemed a waiver of hearing rights.



 



   C.   At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall make findings
and determine whether the building falls within the scope of this division
and whether the building or structure should be repaired or demolished and
how much time, if any, should be given for compliance with the Department’s
order.



 



91.8903.7.3.  Time Limits for Vacant Buildings.  Any appeal or request for
hearing to the Board for an extension of time to repair or demolish a vacant
privately owned building shall be decided by the Board no later than 30 days
after the hearing thereon and may be granted only on the condition that such
repairs be completed within a maximum period of 180 days after the date of
the Board’s first action to grant an extension of time and on the further
condition that no additional time will be granted.



 



91.8903.7.4.  Notification.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)
Only those persons who request a hearing need to be notified of the date and
time of the hearing.  Notification shall be made by certified mail, postage
prepaid, return receipt requested, to the address as shown on the hearing
request application.  The employee of the Department, upon giving notice as
provided in this division, shall create and sign an affidavit certifying to
the date and manner in which such notice was served.  Any receipt card which
may have been returned to the employee in acknowledgment of the receipt of
such notice by certified mail shall be maintained with the affidavit.



 



 



SEC. 91.8904.  SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR VACANT PROPERTY GRAFFITI REMOVAL.



   (Title and Section Amended by Ord. No. 171,175, Eff. 7/25/96.)



 



91.8904.1.  Duties of the Owner of Vacant Property.  (Amended by Ord. No.
185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)  It shall be unlawful for the owner or person in
control of a parcel of land to permit the accumulation of trash, debris,
vehicle parts, rubbish, excessive vegetation or other similar nuisance
conditions on a parcel or in and around any building or structure located on
a parcel.  The Department may order the fencing of such a parcel in the
manner described below.



 



   It shall be unlawful for the owner or person in control of a parcel of
land to allow a vacant building or structure to be open to unauthorized entry
on that land.  The entire building or structure shall be securely
maintained.  The owner or person in control of a vacant building, structure,
or lot which is open to unauthorized entry shall secure all openings,
accessible for entry from the exterior of the building or structure, and
where appropriate, the entire lot itself, with one of the following methods:



 



   1.   Minimum 3/4 inch (19.05 mm) exterior grade plywood.  The
plywood shall have a positive connection to the building or structure using
minimum 1/2 inch (12.7 mm) bolts which shall not be removable from the
outside.



 



   2.   Minimum 16-gauge steel mesh attached to a minimum 1 inch by 1/8
inch (25 mm x 3.175 mm) angle iron frame.  The frame shall have a positive
connection to the building or structure using minimum 1/2 inch (12.7 mm)
bolts which shall not be removable from the outside.



 



   3.   Other means of barricading as directed or approved by the
Department including wrought iron fencing of the lot.  The Department may,
working in cooperation with the Police Department, develop standards for
alternative fencing.



 



   Unless directed otherwise by the Department, the owner or person in
control of a parcel of land also shall erect a 10 foot (3048 mm) high,
unobstructed, chain link fence complete with lockable gates.  The fence,
once constructed, shall become the property of the owner of the property upon
which it is constructed and, all structures on the property, including the
fence shall be maintained in good repair.  In the event that the fence or
other barriers cannot be maintained in good repair, the Department may order
an alternative method of barricading.  The property so fenced shall be
conspicuously posted with a "No Trespassing" sign pursuant to LAMC Section
41.24.



 



   It shall also be unlawful for the owner or person in control of a
parcel of land to allow to exist any graffiti on any walls, temporary or
permanent structures, places, or other surfaces when that graffiti, as
defined in LAMC Section 49.84.2, is visible from a public street or other
public or private property.



 



   The owner or person in control of a parcel of land, whose property
displays graffiti, shall completely remove the graffiti by washing,
sandblasting or chemical treatment or shall completely and uniformly cover or
otherwise obscure the graffiti with paint or other approved materials.



 



   It is unlawful to maintain a swimming pool in violation of LAMC
Sections 91.3109 and 91.6109.  The 10 foot (3048 mm) high chain link fence
described above may be used to comply with LAMC Section 91.3109.  The
swimming pool water shall be removed if the property is vacant.



 



91.8904.1.1.  Procedure for Securing Vacant Property and Removing Graffiti
– Notification.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)  The City
Council finds that the following conditions constitute a public nuisance: the
maintenance of vacant buildings or structures open to unauthorized entry; the
storage and accumulation of trash, debris, vehicle parts or other items
prohibited under LAMC Section 91.8904; and the maintenance of vacant or
occupied property with graffiti visible from a public street or alley as
described in LAMC Section 91.8904.



 



   If the property owner or person in control consents to the removal of
the graffiti, the City may enter upon the property and remove such graffiti.



 



   If the owner or person in control refuses to remove the graffiti, or if
any of the public nuisance conditions above-described exist, then the
Department of Building and Safety may issue an order by certified mail,
return receipt requested, or may deposit an order in the United States mail
in a sealed envelope, postage prepaid, to the owner as shown on the last
equalized assessment roll to abate these conditions.  A copy of the order
shall also be posted on the subject property.  The order may give no more
than ten days from the date the notice was mailed to perform the work.



 



   However, if the order is served by way of personal service, the order
may give no more than five days from the date the order was served to perform
the work.



 



91.8904.1.2  Abatement by the City.  (Amended by Ord. No. 172,702, Eff.
8/16/99.)  In the event the nuisance, including graffiti, is not removed or
otherwise eliminated or abated by the date specified in the notice, the City,
or its contractor, may enter upon the parcel and remove or eliminate the
nuisance.  Abatement may be accomplished by contract or work order and may
be performed by a private contractor submitting a competitive sealed bid, a
public entity performing under a Memorandum of Understanding or by means of
an Annual Awarded Contract.



 



   For the purposes of this section, an Annual Awarded Contract shall mean
one or more 12-month contracts awarded by the Department after competitive
bidding.  The contracts may be based upon both stipulated prices and unit
cost for the fencing of vacant or vacated property; for removal of graffiti
visible from a public street or alley; for draining swimming pools; for the
securing of vacant buildings open to unauthorized entry; for the removal of
debris, rubbish, excessive vegetation, weed abatement or similar nuisance
conditions on property containing a vacant building or vacant lots, when and
as directed by the Department by means of a work order.  No work order shall
be executed except in conjunction with the necessary contract or contracts.



 



   If abatement is performed by a City department other than the
Department of Building and Safety, that department shall bill the owner for
the cost of removal, or other elimination or abatement of the nuisance,
including administrative costs.  An itemized written report showing the date
and cost of abatement work done by the City or its contractor shall be
submitted to the Department.  Payment for the cost of abatement and recovery
of the cost from the property owner shall be pursuant to LAMC Section
91.8906.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)



 



   If the building again becomes open to unauthorized entry, or graffiti
is again visible from a public street or alley, or the building's premises or
vacant parcel again contain debris, rubbish, excessive vegetation or other
similar nuisance conditions, the Department may, upon 3 days notice to the
owner, execute a contract or work order to have the required work performed
by one of the methods provided by this section.  The cost of performing the
work may be paid from the "Repair and Demolition Fund" as established in LAMC
Section 91.8906.  Further, the provisions of LAMC Subsections 91.8903.4,
91.8903.5 and 91.8903.6 shall apply to this section.  (Amended by Ord. No.
185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)



 



   The above abatement procedures are in addition to any other remedy the
Department may choose to pursue to eliminate the nuisance conditions.



 



   This section may also be used to abate graffiti that is observable from
a public road, public right-of-way, or other property that is freely open to
the public, as defined in Section 49.84.2 of the Los Angeles Municipal
Code.  (Amended by Ord. No. 180,708, Eff. 7/6/09.)



 



   If at the time of removal of the graffiti the owner or occupants
object, then the City will immediately obtain the necessary consent,
warrants, or court order prior to completion of the graffiti removal.  This
section should not be administered in any way that would violate the
constitutional rights of any person.



 



91.8904.2.  Abatement of Vacant Buildings or Structures that are Open to
Unauthorized Entry and Fire Damaged or Repeatedly Used for Illegal
Purposes.  (Amended by Ord. No. 171,175, Eff. 7/25/96.)



 



91.8904.2.1 (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)  Any vacant
buildings open to unauthorized entry that become fire damaged or used
repeatedly by vagrants and gang members or for other illegal purposes,
constitute a public nuisance.  The expeditious repair or demolition of such
vacant buildings and attached or detached appurtenances is essential in order
to eliminate fire hazards, and public nuisance conditions which adversely
affect the public safety and have a blighting effect on the neighborhood. 
It is the purpose of this section to establish a fair and expeditious
procedure which may be used in connection with those buildings and attached
or detached appurtenances.



 



91.8904.2.2.  Procedures.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.) 
The Department may declare a vacant building to be a public nuisance building
under the following circumstances:



 



   1.   The vacant building has been secured pursuant to LAMC
Subsection 91.8904.1;



 



   2.   It has subsequently become open to unauthorized entry; and



 



   3.   It has become fire damaged or is used repeatedly without the
owner’s permission by vagrants, criminals, or gangs or for other illegal
purposes.



 



   If the Department determines that a vacant building is a public
nuisance building as defined in this section, then the Department may proceed
to abate the public nuisance building utilizing the procedures set forth in
LAMC Subsections 91.8907.2, 91.8907.3 and 91.8907.4.  The cost of any work
done by the City or its contractor to abate the nuisance may be collected
from the property owner in accordance with the procedures set forth in LAMC
Section 91.8906.



 



   A copy of any order issued pursuant to this section shall be provided
to the Fire Department and Police Department.



 



91.8904.3.  Inspection Fee for Periodic Inspection of Property and
Buildings.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)  Whenever the
Department determines after notice and hearing that a property or building
requires a monthly inspection in order to abate a public nuisance and
encourage future maintenance in compliance with applicable codes, the
Department may inspect monthly and assess fees pursuant to LAMC Section
98.0412.  These fees shall be imposed annually when the nuisance condition
is abated by the City pursuant to this division but not more than once during
any twelve month period.



 



   The notice of hearing and intent to impose the annual fee shall be
mailed to the owner as listed on the last equalized assessment roll or
supplemental roll.  The matter shall be scheduled for hearing before the
Board of Building and Safety Commissioners on the date specified on the
notice.  The Board shall determine whether the conditions and previous
record of public nuisance conditions and failure to comply with the Code
justify the imposition of the annual fee and monthly inspection.



 



   The monthly inspection may be accomplished by contract or work order
and may be performed by a private contractor submitting a sealed bid or by
means of an Annual Awarded Monitoring Contract.  An Annual Awarded
Monitoring Contract shall mean one or more 12-month contracts awarded by the
Department after competitive bidding.  Payment for the cost of monthly
inspections shall be made from the Repair and Demolition Fund.  Any payments
received as a result of the annual fee imposed pursuant to this subsection
shall be deposited into the Repair and Demolition Fund.  The property
owner's failure to pay this fee may result in a lien against the property
pursuant to LAMC Subsection 91.8906.2.



 



 



SEC. 91.8905.  SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR VACATING, BARRICADING, REMOVING OR
DEMOLISHING BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES WITHOUT NOTICE.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 171,175, Eff. 7/25/96.)



 



91.8905.1.  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section,
whenever the Department determines that any building, structure, premises or
portion thereof falling within the scope of this division is a present,
imminent, extreme and immediate hazard or danger to life or limb, health or
safety, so as to necessitate the immediate elimination thereof without prior
notice to the owner, the Department may, without an order or notice of any
kind whatsoever and without a hearing, cause the building, structure or
premises or any portion thereof to be immediately vacated, barricaded,
removed or demolished by such means as the Department may deem advisable,
including the use of the Department’s annual awarded demolition contractor.



 



91.8905.2.  Buildings or structures which are vacated pursuant to this
section shall be locked and otherwise secured against ingress and the
Department shall post thereon, in a conspicuous place near the entrance, a
placard warning the building is unsafe.



 



   Any warning placard posted pursuant to this section shall not be
defaced, covered, removed, or hidden from view in any manner.



 



91.8905.3.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.) The Department may
cause the building, structure or premises or any portion of the building,
structure or premises to be immediately barricaded, removed or demolished. 
The barricading, removal or demolition, including any monitoring or removal
of asbestos, may be accomplished by any City department with the forces to
perform the work, upon receipt of a request from the Department, or by any
forces under contract to the City.  Where the work is accomplished either by
contract or City forces, the cost shall be paid from the "Repair and
Demolition Fund" as established in LAMC Section 91.8906.



 



   All costs incurred pursuant to this section shall be a personal
obligation against the property owner upon which the particular building or
structure or any portion is located, recoverable by the City in an action
before any court of competent jurisdiction.  These costs shall include an
amount equal to 40 percent of the cost to perform the actual work, but not
less than the sum of $100.00, to cover the City’s costs for administering
any contract and supervising the work required.  In addition to this
personal obligation and all other remedies provided by law, the City may
collect any judgment, fee, cost, or charge, including any permit fees, fines,
late charges, or interest, incurred in relation to the provisions of this
section as provided in Los Angeles Administrative Code Sections 7.35.1
through 7.35.8.



 



91.8905.4.  The administrative fee of 40 percent of the costs shall not be
included in the calculation of costs incurred for or arising out of any
barricading, removal or demolition resulting from an event or course of
events that prompted a declaration of a state of emergency, local emergency,
war emergency or major disaster by the Mayor, the Governor of the State, or
by the President of the United States.  (Amended by Ord. No. 175,596, Eff.
12/7/03.)

   (Amended by Ord. No. 171,175, Eff. 7/25/96.)



 



91.8906.1.  Repair and Demolition Fund.



 



91.8906.1.1.  Established by City Council.  The City Council has set up a
special revolving fund designated as the repair and demolition fund. 
Payments shall be made out of said fund upon the demand of the Department to
defray the costs and expenses which may be incurred by said Department in
causing the necessary work of repair, securing, cleaning or demolition of
buildings, structures and portions thereof or premises which fall within the
scope of this division.



 



91.8906.1.2.  Transfer of Funds.  The City Council may at any time transfer
to the repair and demolition fund, out of any money in the General Fund of
the City, sums as it may deem necessary in order to ensure the performance of
the work of repair, securing, cleaning or demolition, and the sum so
transferred shall be deemed a loan to a special fund and shall be repaid out
of the proceeds of the collection of costs provided for in this division. 
All funds collected under the proceedings provided for below, either upon
voluntary payments or as the result of the involuntary sale of the property,
shall be paid when collected to the City Treasurer, who shall place the funds
in the repair and demolition fund.  (Amended by Ord. No. 175,596, Eff.
12/7/03.)



 



91.8906.1.3.  Maximum Amount in Fund.  At the close of each fiscal year,
with the exception of money deposited from the Community Development Trust
Fund in connection with the Rental Housing Rehabilitation Program, all monies
in said repair and demolition fund in excess of $250,000.00, over and above
the amount of outstanding liabilities payable out of such fund, shall be
transferred to the salary account of the Department of Building and Safety
for use in building conservation work.



 



91.8906.2.  Collection of Repair and Demolition Costs.  (Amended by Ord.
No. 181,758, Eff. 8/8/11.)  Whenever the Department has caused the repair,
securing, cleaning or demolition of any building, structure, or portion of a
building, structure or any premises, all costs incurred under the provisions
of this division of this Code shall be a personal obligation against the
property owner or responsible interested parties in charge or control of the
property, recoverable by the City in an action before any court of competent
jurisdiction.  These costs shall include an amount equal to 40 percent of
the cost to perform the actual work to cover the City’s costs for
administering any contract and supervising the work required.  In addition
to this personal obligation and all other remedies provided by law, the City
may collect any judgment, fee, cost, or charge, including any permit fees,
fines, late charges, or interest, incurred in relation to the provisions of
this Section as provided in Los Angeles Administrative Code Sections 7.35.1
through 7.35.8.

SEC. 91.8907.  ABATEMENT OF PUBLIC NUISANCE CONDITIONS RELATED TO A DECLARED
LOCAL EMERGENCY.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 171,175, Eff. 7/25/96.)



 



91.8907.1.  Declaration of Purpose.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff.
7/16/18.)  Both the expeditious cleanup of the debris and the removal of
irreparably damaged buildings resulting from declared local emergencies are
essential in order to eliminate public nuisance conditions which may
adversely affect the public health, safety and welfare.  It is the purpose
of this section to establish a fair and expeditious procedure which may be
utilized in connection with declared local emergencies for the abatement of
public nuisances, which includes hazardous buildings and debris.



 



   Accordingly, the Department is hereby authorized to issue orders
requiring property owners to abate public nuisances.  The Department is also
authorized to cause the demolition of hazardous buildings and to remove the
debris, rubbish or other dangerous or injurious materials; or to take other
action as necessary to abate public nuisance conditions, and to cause the
cost of the demolition, removal or abatement to become a special lien against
the property.  (Amended by Ord. No. 179,324, Eff. 12/10/07, Oper. 1/1/08.)



 



   The terms "nuisance" and "hazardous buildings" are defined in LAMC
Section 91.8902.  As used in this section, the term "debris" includes burned
or partially burned building materials, members, or portions thereof, ash,
damaged appliances, broken concrete, loose bricks, glass, metal and downed
trees.



 



   This procedure is in addition to any other procedure that is currently
authorized for abatement of such public nuisances.  Notwithstanding any
provision of this section, the Department may at any time exercise its lawful
authority to summarily and immediately abate public nuisances pursuant to
LAMC Section 91.8905.



 



91.8907.2.  Notice.  Whenever the Department discovers the existence of a
public nuisance, including debris and hazardous buildings, the Department may
issue an order for the premises upon which the nuisance is discovered to the
person listed as the owner of the premises, based on the last equalized
assessment roll or supplemental roll.  A copy of the order shall be posted
in a conspicuous place on the parcel or premises, and a copy shall also be
mailed to the person listed as the owner based on the last equalized
assessment roll or supplemental roll.  The failure of any owner or other
person to receive such notice shall not affect in any manner the validity of
any of the proceedings taken thereunder.  Proof of giving any notice may be
made by an affidavit of any employee of the City, which shows service in
conformity with this section.  The order shall indicate:



 



   1.   The street address, or the approximate street address if no
street address has been assigned, of the property on which the nuisance
exists;



 



   2.   That the condition on the premises as described in the order
constitutes a public nuisance;



 



   3.   That the owner or owner’s agent is required to obtain all
necessary permits to abate the public nuisance within 10 days from the date
of the order, and to commence and complete all necessary work within 30 days
from the date of the order;



 



   4.   That the owner must appear at a hearing conducted by the Board,
at a time, date and location specified in the order, which shall be at least
15 days from the date of the order;



 



   5.   That upon any such appearance the owner will be given the
opportunity to present and to elicit testimony and other evidence to show
cause why the alleged nuisance should not be abated by the owner or by the
City using its own forces or through contract;



 



   6.   That such appearance may be made by the submission of written
materials if they have been received by the City at least three days prior to
the scheduled hearing at the mailing address specified in the order;



 



   7.   That if a public nuisance is found to exist on the property and
the owner fails to abate that nuisance, then the Department has the authority
to cause the demolition of hazardous buildings and removal of debris, rubbish
or other dangerous or injurious materials as necessary to abate public
nuisance conditions;



 



   8.   That the cost of abatement of the public nuisance by the City
may become a special lien against the premises.  (Amended by Ord. No.
179,324, Eff. 12/10/07, Oper. 1/1/08.).



 



91.8907.3.  Pre-abatement Hearing.



 



91.8907.3.1.  The matter shall be scheduled for hearing before the Board on
the date and time specified in the order.  The Board shall proceed to
determine whether the conditions existing on the premises constitute a public
nuisance.



 



91.8907.3.2.  The person notified to appear, or the actual owner of the
parcel or premises in the event the person notified is not the owner, or any
person representing the owner, who attends the hearing, shall be given an
opportunity to present and to elicit testimony and any other evidence on
whether a public nuisance exists, and to show cause why the alleged nuisance
conditions should not be abated by the owner or by the City using its own
forces or through contract.  The Board shall proceed with the hearing
whether or not such person is in attendance.  Written material shall be
considered by the Board if it is received three days prior to the scheduled
hearing.



 



91.8907.3.3.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the Board shall make a
finding and determine whether the premises are a public nuisance, and how
much additional time, if any, should be given to the owner for compliance
with the Department’s order.  Once the Board has acted, it shall have no
further jurisdiction over any matter relating to the abatement of the
nuisance conditions on the premises.  Any future determinations in this
regard, including nuisance abatement actions or requests for extensions of
time, shall be within the sole jurisdiction and discretion of the
Superintendent of Building and not appealable to the Board.



 



91.8907.3.4.  The owner and any other person who appeared at the scheduled
hearing on behalf of the owner, either in person or by the submission of
written material, shall be notified in writing of the determination of the
Board.



 



91.8907.4.  Abatement.  (Amended by Ord. No. 175,596, Eff. 12/7/03.)  If
the Board finds that a public nuisance exists, and if the Department
determines that permits were not obtained, or that the nuisance was not
removed or otherwise abated by the dates specified in the order, then the
City or its contractor may enter upon the premises to demolish hazardous
buildings, monitor or remove asbestos, remove debris, rubbish or other
dangerous or injurious materials, and take other action as necessary to abate
the nuisance.  The work may be accomplished by any City department with the
forces to perform the work, upon receipt of a request from the Department, or
by any forces under contract to the City.  Further, if the work qualifies,
then it may be done as part of the City-sponsored demolition and debris
removal program approved in concept by the City Council on May 22, 1992.



 



   Where the work is accomplished by other than City forces, the cost may
be paid from the Repair and Demolition Fund as established in LAMC Section
91.8906.  All costs incurred pursuant to this section shall be a personal
obligation against the owner of the property upon which the nuisance is
located, recoverable by the City in an action before any court of competent
jurisdiction.  These costs shall include an amount equal to 40% of the cost
to perform the actual work, but not less than the sum of $100.00, to cover
the City's costs for administering any contract and supervising the work
required, unless the work is necessitated by an event or course of events
that prompts the declaration of a state of emergency, local emergency, war
emergency or major disaster by the Mayor, the Governor of the State, or by
the President of the United States. In addition to this personal obligation
and all other remedies provided by law, the City may collect any judgment,
fee, cost, or charge, including any permit fees, fines, late charges, or
interest, incurred in relation to the provisions of this section as provided
in Los Angeles Administrative Code Sections 7.35.1 through 7.35.8.  (Amended
by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)



 



 



SEC. 91.8908.  SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR THE REPAIR OF WELDED STEEL MOMENT
FRAME BUILDINGS LOCATED IN HIGH EARTHQUAKE DAMAGED AREAS.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 171,175, Eff. 7/25/96.)



 



91.8908.1.  Welded steel moment frame buildings located in high earthquake
damaged areas experienced damage in the beam to column moment connection as a
result of the earthquake of January 17, 1994 and its aftershocks.  Except as
provided by this section, it is unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation
to maintain a building with damaged welded moment connections.  The purpose
of this section is to provide a practicable method, in addition to any other
remedy available by law, whereby earthquake damaged welded steel frame moment
buildings may be repaired.



 



91.8908.2. If the Department determines that a commercial building is a
welded steel moment frame building located in a high earthquake damaged area,
then the Department may issue an order to the owner, as shown on the last
equalized assessment roll, to repair all damaged welded connections.



 



   Within 180 days of mailing of the order, the building owner shall
submit an inspection report to the Department indicating the number of
damaged welded connections and proposed repair procedures.  This inspection
report shall be prepared under the direction of a structural engineer
licensed by the State of California and shall include the results of any
ultrasonic tests or the results of other approved methods of testing of
connections.  The inspection report shall be approved when it is determined
to be in keeping with general standards established by the Department. 
Permits shall be obtained and repairs to the damaged connections shall
commence within 90 days of the Department’s approval of the submitted
report.  Repairs shall be completed within two years of the date of the
permit.



 



91.8908.3.  For purposes of this section, the following areas are high
earthquake damaged areas:



 



   That area bounded by, Mulholland Drive, Beverly Glen Boulevard, Pico
Boulevard, Overland Avenue, Venice Boulevard, Centinela Avenue, Montana
Avenue, 26th Street, Sunset Boulevard, and Mandeville Canyon Road.



 



   That area of the City which is North of Mulholland Drive, and bounded
by Universal City, Burbank, Glendale, Los Angeles County, and Ventura County.



 



   The City Council, by resolution, may extend the boundaries of these
earthquake damaged areas if it finds that damage has occurred to welded steel
moment frame buildings outside the boundaries described above.  The
Department may issue an order for any welded steel moment frame building
outside of the high earthquake damaged areas if the Department determines
that the building has experienced earthquake damage.  (Amended by Ord. No.
179,324, Eff. 12/10/07, Oper. 1/1/08.)



 



91.8908.4.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)  If an owner fails
to comply with an order issued pursuant to this section within the time set
forth in the order or such additional time as may be granted by the
Department, then the Department may secure compliance utilizing the
procedures set forth in LAMC Section 91.8903.  However, if the Department
utilizes LAMC Section 91.8903, then the order described in LAMC Subdivision
91.8903.1.1 shall indicate that the building is within the scope of Division
89, Article 1, Chapter IX of the LAMC because of the owner's failure to
comply with the requirements of this section.  Further the time for
compliance set forth in LAMC Subdivision 91.8903.1.2 may be reduced to 10
days, and the order to vacate described in LAMC Subdivision 91.8903.1.3 may
be issued whenever the Department deems appropriate.



 



91.8908.5.  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Code to the
contrary, the owner of any building, who fails to comply with an order issued
pursuant to this section within the time limits established in this section,
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.  Further, if the Department determines at
any time that the building is a hazardous building or unsafe to occupy, then
it may order that the building be vacated or that other corrective actions be
taken.

the property whose land use or discretionary zoning approval has been
discontinued or revoked by the Director of Planning or City Council pursuant
to Section 12.27.1 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code.  Notwithstanding the
provisions of Los Angeles Municipal Code Sections 12.26 K. and 98.0403 to the
contrary, there shall be no appeal from this order.  The order shall specify
that the order applies only to that portion of the property whose land use or
discretionary zoning approval has been discontinued or revoked.



 



91.9003.2.  Closure Notification.  The order to vacate the property shall
be sent to the business operator, property owner, lessees, occupants, and to
all persons shown in the title report as having any ownership interest,

discretionary zoning approval that is revoked is a residential use, the
relocation assistance procedure of Section 12.27.1 D.2. of the Los Angeles
Municipal Code shall apply.  The Housing and Community Investment Department
shall identify each tenant eligible for relocation assistance, and shall
issue an order requiring the landlord to pay relocation benefits in the

No tenant who has caused or substantially contributed to the nuisance
activity giving rise to the order to vacate, as determined by the Director of
Planning pursuant to Section 12.27.1 D.2. of the Los Angeles Municipal Code,
shall be eligible for relocation benefits.  (Amended by Ord. No. 182,718,

SEC. 91.9101.  PURPOSE.



   (Added by Ord. No. 169,341, Eff. 2/4/94.)



 



   The purpose of this division is to promote public safety and welfare by
reducing the risk of death or injury that may result from the effects of
earthquakes on tilt-up concrete wall buildings designed under the building
codes in effect prior to January 1, 1976.  Such buildings have been
categorized, based on past earthquakes, as being potentially hazardous and
prone to significant damage, including possible collapse, in a moderate to
major earthquake.



 



   The provisions of this division are minimum standards for structural
seismic resistance established primarily to reduce the risk of life loss or
injury on both subject and adjacent properties and will not necessarily
prevent loss of life or injury or prevent earthquake damage to an existing
building which complies with these standards.  The requirement for
compliance with these standards does not preclude the utilization, at the
building owner’s option, of more extensive strengthening method that might
further prevent or limit loss of life or injury or building damage.  This
division shall not require existing electrical, plumbing, mechanical or
fire-safety systems to be altered unless they constitute a hazard to life or
property.



 



   This division provides systematic procedures and standards for
identification and classification of tilt-up concrete wall building based on
the current use of the building.  Priorities, time periods, and standards
are also established under which these buildings are required to be
structurally analyzed and strengthened for seismic resistance.  Where the
analysis determines structural deficiencies, this division requires the
building to be strengthened or demolished.



 



 



SEC. 91.9102.  SCOPE.



   (Added by Ord. No. 169,341, Eff. 2/4/94.)



 



   The provisions of this division shall apply to all buildings designed
under building codes in effect prior to January 1, 1976, which, on the
effective date of this division have tilt-up concrete walls as defined herein.



 



   Buildings within the scope of the division may not be added to or
structurally altered or remodeled without first complying with the provisions
of this division unless the building official determines that the alteration
is minor in nature.



 



   Seismic strengthening in place prior to the effective date of this
ordinance shall be evaluated according to the provisions of this division and
modified to comply if deficient.



 



 



SEC. 91.9103.  DEFINITIONS.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 172,592, Eff. 6/28/99, Oper. 7/1/99.)



 



   For purposes of this division, the applicable definitions in CBC
Sections 1602, 1902, 2302 and Section 11.2 of ASCE 7, and the following shall
apply:  (Amended by Ord. No. 179,324, Eff. 12/10/07, Oper. 1/1/08.)



 



   COMMENCED CONSTRUCTION.  Construction pursuant to a valid building

Code.  The Superintendent of Building shall have the authority to grant two
one-year extensions in cases of extreme hardship.



 



 



SEC. 91.9107.  HISTORICAL BUILDINGS.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 172,592, Eff. 6/28/99, Oper. 7/1/99.)



 



   Qualified historical buildings may utilize alternate building standards
or deviations from this division to preserve their original or restored
architectural elements and features.  See Section 91.8119 of this Code.



 



 



SEC. 91.9108.  ANALYSIS AND DESIGN.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 171,175, Eff. 7/25/96.)



 



   For the purpose of this section, “anchorage system(s)” shall mean
all structural elements, which supports the wall in the lateral direction,
including wall anchorage and continuity tie (cross-tie) connectors in
subdiaphragms and main diaphragms for retrofit and repairs.



 



91.9108.1.  Wall Panel Anchorage.  Concrete walls shall be anchored to all
floors and roofs which provide lateral support for the wall.  The anchorage
shall provide a positive direct connection between the wall and floor or roof
construction capable of resisting a horizontal force equal to 30 percent of
the tributary wall weight for all buildings, and 45 percent of the tributary
wall weight for essential buildings, or a minimum force of 250 pounds per
linear foot of wall, whichever is greater.  The required anchorage shall be
based on the tributary wall panel assuming simple supports  at floors and
roof.



 



   EXCEPTION:  Alternate design may be approved by the Superintendent
when justified by well established principles of mechanics.



 



91.9108.2.  Special Requirements for Wall Anchors and Continuity Ties. 
(Amended by Ord. No. 181,758, Eff. 8/8/11.)  The steel elements of the wall
anchorage systems and continuity ties shall be designed by the allowable
stress design method using a load factor of 1.7.  The 1/3 stress increase
permitted by CBC Section 1605.3.1.1 shall not be permitted for materials
using allowable stress design methods.



 



   The strength design specified in CBC Section 1912, using a load factor
of 2.0 in lieu of 1.4 for earthquake loading, shall be used for design of
embedment in concrete.



 



   Wall anchors shall be provided to resist out-of-plane forces,
independent of existing shear anchors.



 



   EXCEPTION: Existing cast-in-place shear anchors may be used as wall
anchors if the tie element can be readily attached to the anchors and if the
engineer or architect can establish tension values for the existing anchors
through the use of approved as-built plans or testing, and through analysis
showing that the bolts are capable of resisting the total shear load while
being acted upon by the maximum tension force due to earthquake.  Criteria
for analysis and testing shall be determined by the Superintendent.



 



   Expansion anchors are not allowed without special approval of the
Superintendent.  Attaching the edge of plywood sheathing to steel ledgers is
not considered as complying with the positive anchoring requirements of the
Code; and attaching the edge of steel decks to steel ledgers is not
considered as providing the positive anchorage of this Code unless testing
and/or analysis are performed, which establish shear values for the
attachment perpendicular to the edge of the deck.



 



91.9108.3.  Development of Anchor Loads into the Diaphragm.  (Amended by
Ord. No. 181,758, Eff. 8/8/11.)  Development of anchor loads into roof and
floor diaphragms shall comply with Section 91.1615.4 and Section 12.11 of
ASCE 7.



 



   EXCEPTION: If continuously tied girders are present, then the maximum
spacing of the continuity ties is the greater of the girder spacing or 24
feet (7315 mm).



 



   In wood diaphragms, anchorage shall not be accomplished by use of toe
nails or nails subject to withdrawal, nor shall wood ledgers, top plates or
framing be used in cross-grain bending or cross-grain tension.  The
continuous ties required by Section 91.1615.4 and Section 12.11 of ASCE 7
shall be in addition to the diaphragm sheathing.



 



   Lengths of development of anchor loads in wood diaphragms shall be
based on existing field nailing of the sheathing unless existing edge nailing
is positively identified on the original construction plans or at the site.



 



   At reentrant corners, continuity collectors may be required for
existing return walls not designed as shear walls, to develop into the
diaphragm a force equal to the lesser of the rocking or shear capacity of the
return wall, or the tributary shear, but not exceeding the capacity of the
diaphragm.  Shear anchors for the return wall shall be commensurate with the
collector force.  If a truss or beam, other than rafters or purlins, is
supported by the return wall or by a column integral with the return wall, an
independent secondary column, is required to support the roof or floor
members whenever rocking or shear capacity of the return wall is governing.



 



   Seismic deflection shall be determined at the return walls, and
fins/canopies at entrances, to ensure deflection compatibility with the
diaphragm, by either seismically isolating the element or attaching the
element and integrating its load into the diaphragm.



 



91.9108.4.  Anchorage at Pilasters.  (Amended by Ord. No. 172,592, Eff.
6/28/99, Oper. 7/1/99.)  Anchorage of pilasters shall be designed for the
tributary wall anchoring load per Section 91.9108.1 of this Code, considering
the wall as a two-way slab.  The edge of the two-way slab shall be
considered “fixed” when there is continuity at pilasters, and considered
“pinned” at roof or floor levels.  The pilasters or the walls
immediately adjacent to the pilasters shall be anchored directly to the roof
framing such that the existing vertical anchor bolts at the top of the
pilasters are by-passed without causing tension or shear failure at the top
of the pilasters.



 



   EXCEPTION:  If existing vertical anchor bolts at the top of the
pilasters are used for the anchorage, then additional exterior confinement
shall be provided.



 



   The minimum anchorage at a floor or roof between the pilasters shall be
that specified in Section 91.9108.1 of this Code.



 



91.9108.5.  Symmetry.  Symmetry of connectors in the anchorage system is
required.  Eccentricity may be allowed when it can be shown that all
components of forces are positively resisted and justified by calculations or
tests.



 



91.9108.6.  Minimum Roof Member Size.  Wood members used to develop
anchorage forces to the diaphragm must be at least 3x for new construction
and replacement.  All such members must be checked for gravity and
earthquake as part of the wall anchorage system.  For existing buildings,
the member check shall be without the 1/3 stress increase per Section
91.9108.2.



 



91.9108.7.  Combination of Anchor Types.  To repair and retrofit existing
buildings, a combination of different anchor types of different behavior or
stiffness shall not be permitted.  The capacity of the new and existing
connectors cannot be added.



 



91.9108.8.  Prohibited Anchors.  Usage of connectors that were bent and/or
stretched from the intended use shall be prohibited.



 



91.9108.9.  Crack and Damage Repairs, Evaluation of Existing Structural
Alterations.  The engineer shall report any observed structural conditions
and structural damage that have imminent life safety effects on the buildings
and recommend repairs.  Evaluations and repairs shall be reviewed and
approved by the Department.  The engineer shall also evaluate the effects of
alterations such as openings cut in existing wall panels without a permit,
that may present immediate life safety hazard and correct when necessary.



 



91.9108.10.  Miscellaneous.  Existing mezzanines relying on the tilt-up
walls for vertical and/or lateral support shall be anchored to the walls for
the tributary mezzanine load.  Walls depending on the mezzanine for lateral
support shall be anchored per Sections 91.9108.1, 91.9108.2 and 91.9108.3.



 



   EXCEPTION:  Existing mezzanines that have independent lateral and
vertical support need not be anchored to the walls.



 



   Existing interior masonry or concrete walls not designed as shear
walls, that extend to the floor above or to the roof diaphragm shall also be
anchored for out-of-plane forces per Sections 91.9108.1, 91.9108.2 and
91.9108.3 of this Code.  In the in-plane direction, the walls may be
isolated or shall be developed into the diaphragm for a lateral force equal
to the lesser of the rocking or shear capacity of the wall, or the tributary
shear but not exceeding the diaphragm capacity.

dimensions and sizes for plan review and construction.  The following shall
be provided:



 



   1.   Floor plans and roof plans shall show existing framing
construction, diaphragm construction, proposed wall anchors, cross-ties and
collectors.  Existing nailing, anchors, ties and collectors shall also be
shown on the plans if these are part of the design, and these structural
elements need to be verified in the field.



 



   2.   At elevations where there are alterations or damage, details
shall show roof and floor heights, dimensions of openings, location and
extent of existing damage, and proposed repair.



 



   3.   Typical wall panel sections with panel thickness, height,
location of anchors shall be provided.



 



   4.   Details shall include existing and new anchors and the method

VOLUNTARY – EARTHQUAKE HAZARD REDUCTION IN EXISTING WOOD FRAME RESIDENTIAL
BUILDINGS WITH WEAK CRIPPLE WALLS AND UNBOLTED SILL PLATES

SEC. 91.9201.  GENERAL.



   (Added by Ord. No. 171,259, Eff. 8/30/96.)



 



91.9201.1.  Purpose. The provisions of this division are intended to promote
public safety and welfare by reducing the risk of earthquake-induced damage
to existing wood-framed residential buildings.  The voluntary minimum
standards contained in this division shall substantially improve the seismic
performance of these residential buildings but will not necessarily prevent
all earthquake damage. When fully followed, these standards will strengthen
the portion of the structure that is most vulnerable to earthquake damage.



 



   Prior to 1960, most wood frame residential buildings were built with
raised wood floors supported by short wood stud walls known as cripple
walls.  These cripple walls are typically braced with weak seismic materials
such as portland cement plaster or horizontal wood siding.  In addition,
wood frame buildings built under building codes in effect prior to  July
1938 were not required to be bolted to their foundations. Recent earthquakes
have shown that if a building has weak cripple walls or is unbolted, it may
fall off its foundation even in moderate earthquakes.  Fallen buildings have
collapsed, caught fire or needed extensive repairs to restore their occupancy.



 



   This division sets prescriptive standards for strengthening of
underfloor enclosures that shall be permitted by the Superintendent of
Building without requiring plans or calculations prepared by an architect or
an engineer.  This division also provides a design standard for the use of
alternate materials or an alternate method of construction in lieu of the
prescriptive standards.  Construction documents for strengthening using
alternate materials or methods shall be prepared by an architect or engineer.



 



91.9201.2.  Scope.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)    The
provisions of this division may be applied to light wood frame Group R
Occupancies with no more than four dwelling units when they contain one or
more of the structural weaknesses specified in LAMC Subsection 91.9203.1.



 



   The provisions of this division do not apply to the buildings or
building elements, listed below.  These buildings or elements require
analysis by an engineer or architect in accordance with Division 16, Article
1, Chapter IX of the LAMC or other approved standards to determine
appropriate strengthening.



 



   1.   Buildings with a lateral force resisting system using poles or
columns embedded in the ground.

conditions exist that are beyond the scope of the requirements of this
division.



 



   The standard details approved by the Superintendent of Building and
these prescriptive provisions are not intended to be the only acceptable
strengthening methods permitted.  Alternate details and methods shall be
permitted when approved by the Superintendent of Building.  Qualified
Historical Buildings shall be permitted to use alternate building regulations
of LAMC Section 91.8119 in order to preserve their original or restored
architectural elements and features.



 



91.9201.3.  Alternative Design Procedures.  (Amended by Ord. No. 179,324,
Eff. 12/10/07, Oper. 1/1/08.)  When analysis by an engineer or architect is
required or provided for a building within the scope of this division, that
analysis shall be in accordance with all requirements of this Code except as
provided in this division.  The design shall provide strengthening for any
structural weakness listed in LAMC Section 91.9203 that is at least
equivalent to that provided by the prescriptive requirements of this division
with respect to strength, deflection, and capacity.  The Superintendent of
Building may require that sufficient evidence be submitted to substantiate
that equivalence.  The base shear may be determined in accordance with the
following:



 



   V = 0.1375 W   (92-1)



 



   Where:



 



   V = The total design lateral force or shear at the base.



 




   W = The total seismic dead load defined in Section 12.7.2 of ASCE 7.

   For the purpose of this division, in addition to the applicable
definitions, symbols and notations in this Code, certain additional terms are
defined as follows:



 



   ADHESIVE ANCHOR is a fastener placed in hardened concrete or masonry
that derives its holding strength from a chemical adhesive compound placed
between the wall of the hole and the embedded portion of the anchor.

   6.   Cripple walls that are not braced in accordance with the
requirements of LAMC Subsection 91.9204.4 and LAMC Table 92-A.



 



 



SEC. 91.9204.  STRENGTHENING REQUIREMENTS.



   (Added by Ord. No. 171,259, Eff. 8/30/96.)



 



91.9204.1.  General.



 



91.9204.1.1.  Scope.  (Amended by Ord. No. 179,324, Eff. 12/10/07, Oper.
1/1/08.)  The structural weaknesses noted in LAMC Section 91.9203 shall be
strengthened in accordance with the requirements of this section. 
Strengthening work shall be allowed to include both new construction and
alteration of existing construction.  Except as provided here, all
strengthening work and materials shall comply with the applicable provisions
of this Code.  All prescribe nailing in this Division shall be common
nails.  Alternate methods of strengthening shall be allowed provided the
systems are designed by an engineer or architect and approved by the
Superintendent of Building.



 



91.9204.1.2.  Condition of Existing Wood Materials.  All existing wood
materials which will be a part of the strengthening work shall be in a sound
condition and free from defects which substantially reduce the capacity of
the member.  Any wood material found to contain fungus infection shall be
removed and replaced with new material.  Any wood material found to be
infested with insects or to have been infested shall be strengthened or
replaced with new materials to provide a net dimension of sound wood at least
equal to its undamaged original dimension.



 



91.9204.1.3.  Floor Joists Not Parallel to Foundations.  Floor joists
framed perpendicular or at an angle to perimeter foundations shall be
restrained by either a nominal two-inch (51 mm) wide continuous rim joist or
a nominal two-inch (51 mm) wide full depth blocking between alternate joists
in one- and two-story buildings, and between each joist in three-story
buildings.  Blocking for multistory buildings must occur at each joist space
above a braced cripple wall panel.



 



   Existing connections at the top edge of an existing rim joist or
blocking need not be verified.  The bottom edge connection to either the
foundation sill plate or top plate of a cripple wall shall be verified unless
a supplemental connection is provided.  The minimum existing bottom edge
connection shall consist of 8d toe nails spaced six inches (152 mm) apart for
a continuous rim joist or three 8d toe nails per block.  When this minimum
bottom edge connection is not present, or  is not verified, a supplemental
connection shall be provided.



 



   When an existing continuous rim joist or the minimum existing blocking
does not occur, new 1-1/8 inch (29 mm) wood structural panel blocking
installed tightly between floor joists and nailed with 10d common nails at
four inches on center to the sill or wall top plate shall be provided at the
inside face of the cripple wall.  In lieu of 1-1/8 inch (29 mm) wood
structural panel blocking, tight fitting, full or near full depth two inches
nominal width (51 mm) lumber blocking shall be allowed provided it does not
split during installation.  New blocking  is not required where it will
interfere with vents or plumbing which penetrates the wall.



 



91.9204.1.4.  Floor Joists Parallel to Foundations.  Where existing floor
joists are parallel to the perimeter foundations, the end joist shall be
located over the foundation and, except for required ventilation openings,
shall be continuous and in continuous contact with any existing foundation
sill plate or top plate of the cripple wall.  Existing connections at the
top edge connection of the end joist need not be verified; however, the
bottom edge connection to either the foundation sill plate or the top plate
of a cripple wall shall be verified unless a supplemental connection is
provided.  The minimum bottom edge connection shall be 8d toe nails spaced
six inches (152 mm) apart.  If this minimum bottom edge connection is not
present or  is not verified, a supplemental connection shall be provided.



 



91.9204.1.5.  Supplemental Connections.  Supplemental connections shall
provide sufficient strength to transfer the seismic forces.  Framing anchors
of minimum 18 gauge steel and 12 approved fasteners may be considered to meet
this requirement when spaced 32 inches (813 mm) on center for one story
buildings, 24 inches (610 mm) on center for two story buildings and 16 inches
(406 mm) on center for three story buildings.



 



   EXCEPTION:  A supplemental connection is not required when:



 



   1.   The structural wood panel sheathing extends from the sill plate
to the rim joist or blocking above.



 



   2.   The floor sheathing is nailed directly into the sill or top
plate of the cripple wall.



 



91.9204.1.6.  Single Top Plate Ties.  (Added by Ord. No. 172,018, Eff.
5/21/98.)  When a single top plate exists in the cripple wall, all end
joints in the top plate shall be tied. Ties shall be connected to each end of
the discontinuous top plate and shall be equal to one of the following:



 



   1.   3-inch by 6-inch (76 mm by 152 mm) by 0.036-inch-thick (0.9 mm)
galvanized steel and nailed with six 8d nails at each end.



 



   2.   1-1/2 inches (38 mm) by 12-inch (305 mm) by 0.058 inches (1.47
mm) galvanized steel  nailed with six 16d nails at each end.



 



   3.   2-inch by 4-inch by 12-inch wood blocking nailed with six 16d
nails at each end.



 



91.9204.2.  Foundations.



 



91.9204.2.1.  New Perimeter Foundations.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587,
Eff. 7/16/18.)  New perimeter foundations shall be provided for structures
with the structural weaknesses noted in Items 1 and 2 of LAMC Subsection
91.9203.1.  Soil investigations or geotechnical studies are not required for
this work unless the building shows signs of excessive settlement or creep.



 



91.9204.2.2.  Foundation Evaluation by Engineer or Architect.  Partial
perimeter foundations or unreinforced masonry foundations shall be evaluated
by an engineer or architect for the force levels noted in Formula (92-1). 
Test reports or other substantiating data to determine existing foundation
material strengths shall be submitted for review.  When approved by the
Superintendent of Building, these foundation systems may be strengthened in
accordance with the recommendations included with the evaluation in lieu of
being replaced.



 



   EXCEPTION:  In lieu of testing existing foundations to determine
material strengths and when approved by the Superintendent of Building, a new
nonperimeter foundation system, designed for the forces noted in Formula
(92-1), may be used to resist all exterior wall lateral forces.



 



91.9204.2.3.  Details for New Perimeter Foundations.  (Amended by Ord. No.
179,324, Eff. 12/10/07, Oper. 1/1/08.)  All new perimeter foundations shall
be continuous and constructed according to the standards for new buildings.



 



   EXCEPTIONS:



 



   1.   When approved by the Superintendent of Building, the existing
clearance between existing floor joists or girders and existing grade below
the floor need not comply with CBC Section 2304.11.2.1.  This exception
shall not be permitted when buildings are relocated on new foundations.



 



   2.   When approved by the Superintendent of Building, and when
designed by an engineer or architect, partial perimeter foundations may be
used in lieu of a continuous perimeter foundation.



 



91.9204.3.  Foundation Sill Plate Anchorage.



 



91.9204.3.1.  Existing Perimeter Foundations.  (Amended by Ord. No.
185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)  When the building has an existing continuous
perimeter foundation, all perimeter wall sill plates shall be connected to
the foundation in accordance with LAMC Table 92-A and this section.



 



   Anchors shall be installed with the plate washer installed between the
nut and the sill plate.  The nut shall be tightened to a snug-tight
condition after curing is complete for adhesive anchors and after expansion
wedge engagement for expansion anchors.  The installation of nuts on all
anchors shall be subject to verification by the Superintendent of Building. 
Torque testing shall be performed for 25 percent of all adhesive or expansion
anchors.  Minimum test values shall be 30 foot pounds (41 N-m) for 1/2-inch
(12.7 mm) and 40 foot pounds (55 N-m) for 5/8-inch (15.9 mm) diameter anchors.



 



   Anchor side plates shall be permitted when conditions prevent anchor
installation vertically through the sill plate.  Anchor side plates shall be
spaced as required for adhesive or expansion anchors but only one anchor side
plate is required on individual pieces of sill plate less than 32 inches (813
mm) in length.  Wood structural panel shims shall be used on sill plates for
single plate anchor side plates when the foundation stem wall is from 3/16
inch (4.8 mm) to 3/4 inch (19 mm) wider than the sill plate.  The shim
length shall extend a minimum of two inches (50.8 mm) past each end of the
anchor side plate.  Two plate anchor side plates shall be used when the
total thickness of the required shim exceeds 3/4 inch (19 mm).



 



   All anchor side plates, which use lag or wood screws shall pre-drill
the sill plate to prevent splitting as required by CBC Section 2304.9.  Lag
or wood screws shall be installed in the center of the thickness of the
existing sill plate.



 



   Expansion anchors shall not be used in unreinforced masonry or concrete
or masonry grout of poor quality.  Adhesive anchors shall be required when
expansion anchors will not tighten to the required torque or their
installation causes surface cracking of the foundation wall.



 



91.9204.3.2.  Placement of Anchors.  Anchors shall be placed within 12
inches (305 mm), but not less than nine inches (229 mm), from the ends of
sill plates and shall be placed near the center of the stud space closest to
the required spacing.  New sill plates may be installed in pieces when
necessary because of existing conditions.  The minimum length of new sill
plate pieces shall be 30 inches (762 mm).



 



   EXCEPTION:  Where physical obstructions such as fireplaces, plumbing
or heating ducts interfere with the placement of an anchor, the anchor shall
be placed as close to the obstruction as possible, but not less than nine
inches (229 mm) from the end of the plate.  Center-to-center spacing of the
anchors shall be reduced as necessary to provide the minimum total number of
anchors required based on the full length of the wall.  Center-to-center
spacing shall not be less than 12 inches (305 mm).



 



91.9204.3.3.New Perimeter Foundations.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff.
7/16/18.)  Sill plates for new perimeter foundations shall be anchored as
required by CBC Chapter 19.



 



91.9204.4.  Cripple Wall Bracing.



 



91.9204.4.1.  General.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.) 
Exterior cripple walls, not exceeding 4 feet (1219.2 mm) in height shall use
the prescriptive bracing method listed below.  Cripple walls more than 4
feet (1219.2 mm) in height require analysis by an engineer or architect in
accordance with Division 16, Article 1, Chapter IX of the LAMC.



 



91.9204.4.1.1.  Sheathing Requirements.  Wood structural panel sheathing
shall not be less than 15/32-inch (12 mm) thick.  When used, plywood panels
shall be constructed of five or more plies.  All wood structural panels
shall be nailed with 8d common nails spaced four inches (102 mm) on center at
all edges and at 12 inches (305 mm) on center at each intermediate support
with not less than two nails for each stud.  Nails shall be driven so that
their head or crown is flush with the surface of the sheathing and shall
penetrate the supporting member a minimum of 1-1/2 inch (38 mm).  When a
nail fractures the surface, it shall be left in place and not counted as part
of the required nailing.  A new 8d nail shall be located within two inches
(51 mm) of the discounted nail and hand driven flush with the sheathing
surface.



 



   EXCEPTION:  No. 6 × 1-1/2 inch (38 mm) wood screws may be used for
sheathing nailing when bracing materials are installed on the interior face
of studs and cement plaster or other brittle finishes are on the exterior of
the sheathed wall.



 



   All horizontal joints must occur over nominal two-inch by four-inch (51
mm by 102 mm) blocking installed with the nominal four-inch (102 mm)
dimension against the face of the plywood.  All vertical joints must occur
over studs.  Vertical joints at adjoining pieces of wood structural panels
shall be centered on existing studs such that there is a minimum 1/8 inch
(3.2 mm) between the panels.  Nails shall be placed a minimum of 1/2 inch
(12.7 mm) from the edges of the existing stud.  When such edge distance
cannot be maintained because of the width of the existing stud, a new stud
shall be added adjacent to the existing and connected with 16d common nails
at eight inches (206 mm) on center.  A minimum of three such nails shall be
provided.



 



91.9204.4.2.  Distribution and Amount of Bracing.  (Amended by Ord. No.
185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)  See LAMC Table 92-A for the distribution and amount
of bracing required.  Bracing for a building with three or more floor levels
above cripple wall studs exceeding 14 inches (355.6 mm) in height must be
designed in accordance with Division 16, Article 1, Chapter IX of the LAMC.



 



   The braced panel must be at least two times the height of the cripple
stud wall but not less than 48 inches (1219 mm) in width.  All panels along
a wall shall be nearly equal in length and shall be nearly equally spaced
along the length of the wall.  Braced panels at ends of walls shall be
located as near the end as possible.



 



   Where physical obstructions such as fireplaces, plumbing or heating
ducts interfere with the placement of cripple wall bracing, the bracing shall
then be placed as close to the obstruction as possible.  The total amount of
bracing required shall not be reduced because of obstructions but the
required length of bracing need not exceed the length of the wall.



 



   Underfloor ventilation openings shall be maintained in accordance CBC
Section 1203.  Braced panels may include underfloor ventilation openings
when the height of the solid portion of the panel meets or 75% of the height
of the cripple stud wall.  When the minimum amount of bracing prescribed in
LAMC Table 92-A cannot be installed due to obstructions along any wall, the
bracing must be designed by an architect or engineer in accordance with CBC
Section 1203.3.



 



91.9204.4.3.  Stud Space Ventilation.  When bracing materials are installed
on the interior face of studs forming an enclosed space between the new
bracing and existing exterior finish, each braced stud space must be
ventilated.  Adequate ventilation and access for future inspection shall be
provided by drilling on two-inch to three-inch (51 mm to 76 mm) diameter
round hole through the sheathing nearly centered between each stud at the top
and bottom of the cripple wall.  Such holes should be spaced a minimum of
one-inch (25 mm) clear from the sill or top plates.  In stud spaces
containing sill bolts, the hole shall be located on the center line of the
sill bolt but not closer than one-inch (25 mm) clear from the nailing edge of
the sheathing.



 



   When existing blocking occurs within the stud space, additional
ventilation holes shall be placed above and below the blocking or the
existing block shall be removed and a new nominal two-inch (51 mm) by
four-inch (102 mm) block installed with the nominal four-inch (102 mm)
dimension against the face of the plywood.  For stud heights less than 18
inches (457 mm) only one ventilation hole need be provided.



 



91.9204.4.4.  Existing Underfloor Ventilation.  Existing underfloor
ventilation shall not be reduced without providing equivalent new ventilation
as close to the existing as possible.  New sheathing may be installed around
existing vent openings in braced panels when the length of the panel is
increased a distance equal to the length of the vent opening or one stud
space minimum.



 



   EXCEPTION:  For residential buildings with a post and pier foundation
system where a new continuous perimeter foundation system is being installed,
ventilation shall be provided in accordance with this Code.

SEC. 91.9301.  PURPOSE.



 



   The purpose of this division is to promote public welfare and safety by
reducing the risk of death or injury that may result from the effects of
earthquakes on existing wood-frame multi-story buildings with soft, weak or
open front walls.  In the Northridge Earthquake, many multi-story wood-frame
buildings with tuck-under parking performed poorly and collapsed, causing the
loss of human life, personal injury and property damage.  It has been
determined that the structural vulnerability of this building type is
typically due to soft, weak or open front walls.  This division creates
minimum standards to mitigate hazards from these deficiencies.  Adherence to
these minimum standards will improve the performance of these buildings
during earthquakes and reduce, but not necessarily prevent, the loss of life,
injury or earthquake-related damage.



 



 



SEC. 91.9302.  SCOPE.



 



   The provisions of this division shall apply to all existing buildings
of wood-frame construction, or wood-frame portions thereof, where:



 



   1.   A permit for construction of a new building was applied for
before January 1, 1978, or, if no permit can be located, the structure is
determined by the Department to have been built under building code standards
enacted before January 1, 1978; and



 



   2.   The ground floor portion of the structure contains parking or
other similar open floor space that causes soft, weak or open-front wall
lines, and there exists one or more stories above.



 



   EXCEPTIONS:  This division shall not apply to any building containing
three dwelling units or less if the building is used solely for residential
purposes.  Moreover, notwithstanding any provision of this Code, compliance
with this division shall not require existing electrical, plumbing,
mechanical or fire-safety systems to be altered to comply with existing code
unless they constitute a hazard to life or property.



 



 



SEC. 91.9303.  DEFINITIONS.



 



   The following words and phrases, whenever used in this division, shall
be construed as defined in this section.  Words and phrases not defined here
shall be construed as defined in Division 2 of this Code.



 



   CRIPPLE WALL is a wood-framed stud wall extending from the top of the
foundation wall to the underside of the lowest floor framing of the building.



 



   DWELLING UNIT shall include any individual residential unit within
either an R-1 or R-2 occupancy building, including a mixed-occupancy building
when part of it is either an R-1 or R-2 occupancy.  A dwelling unit shall
include the area of a building that is occupied as a dwelling unit, whether
the building is approved or unapproved for residential use.



 



   GROUND FLOOR is any floor within the wood-frame portion of a building
whose elevation is immediately accessible from an adjacent grade by vehicles
or pedestrians.  The ground floor portion of the structure does not include
any floor that is completely below adjacent grades.



 



   OPEN-FRONT WALL LINE is an exterior wall line, without vertical
elements of the lateral force-resisting system, which requires tributary
seismic forces to be resisted by diaphragm rotation or excessive cantilever
beyond parallel lines of shear walls.  Diaphragms that cantilever more than
25 percent of the distance between lines of lateral force resisting elements
from which the diaphragm cantilevers shall be considered excessive. 
Exterior exit balconies of six feet or less in width shall not be considered
excessive cantilevers.



 



   QUALIFIED HISTORICAL BUILDING is any building designated or currently
in the process of being designated as a "qualified historical building" as
defined in Part 8, Title 24 of the California Code of Regulations.



 



   RETROFIT is an improvement of the lateral force-resisting system by
alteration of existing structural elements or addition of new structural
elements.



 



   SOFT WALL LINE is a wall line, the lateral stiffness of which is less
than what is required by story drift limitations or deformation compatibility
requirements of this division.  In lieu of the engineering analysis required
by this division to determine whether a wall line's lateral stiffness is less
than the aforementioned story drift limitations or deformation compatibility
requirements, a soft wall line may be defined as a wall line in a story where
the wall stiffness is less than 70 percent of the stiffness of the exterior
wall above for the direction under consideration.



 



   STORY is as defined in this Code, but includes any basement or
underfloor space of a building with cripple walls exceeding four feet in
height.



 



   STORY STRENGTH is the total strength of all seismic-resisting elements
sharing the same story shear in the direction under consideration.



 



   WALL LINE is any length of a wall along a principal axis of the
building used to provide resistance to lateral loads.



 



   WEAK WALL LINE is a wall line at the ground floor where the wall
strength is less than 80 percent of the strength of the wall above in the
direction under consideration.

SEC. 91.9307.  OCCUPANT AND TENANT ADVISORY.



 



91.9307.1. Notification to Tenants and Occupants.  When the Department
determines that a building falls within the scope of this division, the owner
shall advise all current and prospective residential and non-residential
tenants, subtenants, lessees, sublessees, or any other person(s) entitled to
the use and/or occupancy of the building of such determination.  With
respect to current and prospective residential tenants, subtenants, lessees,
sublessees, or other person(s) entitled to the use and/or occupancy of the
building, the property owner shall advise such persons of the Department's
determination in a method and written format approved and promulgated by the
Los Angeles Housing and Community Investment Department.  With respect to
current and prospective non-residential tenants, subtenants, lessees,
sublessees, or other person(s) entitled to the use and/or occupancy of the
building, the owner shall advise such persons of the Department's
determination in a method and written format approved and promulgated by the
Department.



 



91.9307.2. Tenant Habitability Plan.  If required by the Rent Stabilization
Ordinance, the property owner shall be required to submit to the Los Angeles
Housing and Community Investment Department a Tenant Habitability Plan
pursuant to Article 2, Chapter XV of the Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC
Section 152.03 B.).  If, upon review of the Tenant Habitability Plan, it is
determined by the Los Angeles Housing and Community Investment Department
that work required under this division affects the tenantability of any
building or residential unit as defined in California Civil Code Section
1941.1, the owner shall be required to pay relocation benefits pursuant to
Article 1, Chapter XV of the Los Angeles Municipal Code (LAMC Section 151.09
G.) to any tenant, subtenant, lessee, sublessee, or other person(s) entitled
to the use and/or occupancy of the building that is affected by the
untenantable conditions or displaced from the residential unit.  However,
the mere undertaking and completion of work performed by the owner pursuant
to this division shall not, in and of itself, result in any building or
residential unit being deemed untenantable or uninhabitable as defined in
California Civil Code Section 1941.1.



 



 



SEC. 91.9308.  HISTORICAL BULDINGS.

91.9309.1. Scope of Analysis.  This division requires the alteration,
repair, replacement or addition of structural elements and their connections
to meet the strength and stiffness in conformance with this Code except as
modified herein.  The lateral-load-path analysis shall include the resisting
elements and connections from the wood diaphragm immediately above any soft,
weak or open wall lines to the foundation.  Stories above the weak wall line
shall be considered in the analysis but need not be modified.



 



91.9309.2. Design Base Shear and Design Parameters.  (Amended by Ord. No.
184,081, Eff. 2/19/16.)  The design force in a given direction shall be 75%
of the design base shear specified in the seismic provision of ASCE 7.  The
value of response modification coefficient, R, need not be less than 3.5,
provided the strengthening systems are not cantilevered column systems and
the strengthened structure will not have vertical structural irregularities
of either type 1a, 1b, 5a or 5b listed in ASCE 7, "Vertical Structural
Irregularities" Table.



 



91.9309.3. Lateral Vertical Systems.  (Amended by Ord. No. 184,081, Eff.
2/19/16.)  Strengthening systems with concrete walls or masonry walls, or
steel braced frames shall not be permitted.

"Horizontal Structural Irregularities" Table, shall be altered to meet the
additional requirements of those sections referenced in the table for the
entire story with weak or open wall lines.



 



91.9309.5. Alternate Analysis, Base Shear and Design Parameters.  Pursuant
to Section 91.104.2.6, the Department may approve alternate design
methodologies that improve the whole first story seismic performance that are
at least equivalent to those prescribed by this division and that achieve the
life safety objectives established by this division.



 



91.9309.6. Additional Anchorage Requirements for Buildings on Hillsides. 
Where any portion of a building within the scope of this division is
constructed on or into a slope steeper than one unit vertical in three units
horizontal (33-percent slope), the lateral-force-resisting system, at and
below the base level diaphragm, shall also be analyzed for the effects of
concentrated lateral loads caused at the building base from the hillside
conditions and comply with the provisions of Division 94 of the Los Angeles
Building Code.



 



91.9309.7. Story Drift Limitations.  The calculated story drift for each
retrofitted story shall not exceed the allowable deformation compatible with
all vertical load-resisting elements and 0.025 times the story height.  The
calculated story drift shall not be reduced by the effects of horizontal
diaphragm stiffness, but shall be increased when these effects produce
rotation.  Drift calculations shall be in accordance with ASCE 7
requirements.



 



91.9309.8. Pole Structures.  The effects of rotation and soil stiffness
shall be included in the calculated story drift where lateral loads are
resisted by vertical elements whose required depth of embedment is determined
by pole formulas.  The coefficient of subgrade reaction used in deflection
calculations shall be based on an approved geotechnical investigation
conducted in accordance with approved geotechnical engineering reports.



 



91.9309.9. P-Delta Effect.  The requirements of the Los Angeles Building
Code shall apply, except as modified herein.  All structural framing
elements and their connections not required by the design to be part of the
lateral force resisting system shall be designed and detailed to be adequate
to maintain support of design dead plus live loads when subject to the
expected deformations caused by seismic forces.  The stress analysis of
cantilever columns shall use an effective length factor of 2.1 for the
direction normal to the axis of the beam.



 



91.9309.10. Ties, Continuity and Collectors.  All parts of the structure
included in the scope of analysis shall be interconnected and the connection
shall be capable of resisting the seismic force created by the parts being
connected as required per the Los Angeles Building Code.



 



 



SEC. 91.9310.  INFORMATION REQUIRED ON PLANS.



 



91.9310.1. General.  For existing and new construction, the plans and
specifications shall be of sufficient clarity to indicate the nature, design
methodology, and extent of the proposed work and to show in detail that it
will conform to the provisions of this division and the Los Angeles Building
Code.



 



91.9310.2. Engineer's or Architect's Statement.  The responsible engineer or
architect shall provide the following statements on the approved plans:



 



   1.   I am responsible for designing this building's seismic
strengthening in compliance with the minimum standards of the Mandatory
Earthquake Hazard Reduction In Existing Wood-Frame Buildings with Soft, Weak

   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code to the contrary, it
shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to maintain, use or
occupy any building within the scope of this division that fails to meet the
minimum earthquake standards specified in this division after receiving an
order described in Section 91.9306.



 



   Any person who violates or causes or permits another person to violate
this division is guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be subject to prosecution
and/or administrative enforcement under the Los Angeles Municipal Code.  For
purposes of this paragraph, "any person" includes an owner, lessor,
sublessor, manager or person in control of a building subject to this
division.  This term shall not include any person who is merely a tenant or
other individual occupying any dwelling unit, efficiency dwelling unit, guest
room or suite in a building.  The legal owner of a building is that person,
firm, corporation, partnership or other entity whose name or title appears on
the record with the Office of the County Recorder, as well as all successors
or assignees of these persons.



 



   EXCEPTION:  This section shall not apply to any building on which work
is proceeding in compliance with the time limits set forth in this division,
or in compliance with any extensions of time granted by the Department or the
Board; or any action, order or determination made by the Department or the
Board in the implementation of this division.



 



 



SEC. 91.9312.  SEVERABILITY.



 



   If any subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this article is for
any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent
jurisdiction or by reason of any preemptive legislation, such decision or

   (Amended by Ord. No. 172,592, Eff. 6/28/99, Oper. 7/1/99.)



 



   The purpose of this division is to promote public safety and welfare by
reducing the risk of death or injury that may result from the effects of
earthquakes on existing hillside buildings constructed on or into slopes in
excess of one unit vertical in three units horizontal (33.3% slope).  Such
buildings have been recognized as life hazardous as a result of partial or
complete collapse that occurred during the Northridge Earthquake.



 



   The provisions of this division are minimum standards for structural
systems established primarily to reduce the risk of loss of life or injury
resulting from earthquakes and will not necessarily prevent loss of life or

   (Amended by Ord. No. 182,850, Eff. 1/3/14.)



 



91.9406.1.  General.  Every hillside building within the scope of this
division shall be analyzed, designed, and constructed in accordance with the
following provisions.



 



91.9406.1.1.  Base for Seismic Design Defined.  (Amended by Ord. No.
179,324, Eff. 12/10/07, Oper. 1/1/08.)  The base for seismic design is
defined as follows:



 



   1.   Downhill-Direction.  For seismic forces acting in the
downhill-direction, the base of the building shall be the floor at or closest
to the top of the highest level of the foundation.



 



   2.   Normal to the Downhill-Direction.  For seismic forces acting
normal to the downhill-direction, the distribution of seismic forces over the
height of the building using Section 12.8.3 of ASCE 7 shall be determined
using the height measured from the top of the lowest level of the building
foundation.  Retrofitting, however, shall only be required at the
base-level-diaphragm and below.



 



91.9406.1.2.  Design Base Shear.  The design base shear shall be that
required at the time of the original building permit, or not less than 75
percent of the currently required by Section 12.8.1 of ASCE 7, but in no case
not less than the following:



 



   V= 0.133 W



 



   Where:



 



      V = The total design lateral force or shear at the base.



 



      W = The total seismic dead load defined in Section 12.7.2 of ASCE

91.9406.2.1.  General.  The base shear in the downhill-direction, including
forces from the base-level-diaphragm, shall be resisted through primary
anchors from diaphragm struts or collectors provided in the base level
framing to the foundation.



 



91.9406.2.2.  Location of Primary Anchors.  A primary anchor and diaphragm
strut or collector shall be provided in line with each foundation extending
in the downhill-direction.  Primary anchors and diaphragm struts or
collectors shall also be provided where interior vertical lateral force
resisting elements occur above and in contact with the base-level-diaphragm.



 



   The base-level-diaphragm shall be provided with primary anchors
designed for the tributary forces spaced at a maximum 30 feet (9145 mm) on
center.  Where the floor below the base extends to the uphill foundation,
and the foundation at the base  is not adequate to resist the forces from
the primary anchors, the base shear may be transferred to that lower level
and the primary anchorage made at that lower level.  The connection shall be
made directly to the foundation.  The existing foundation shall be evaluated
as specified in LAMC Subsection 91.9406.11.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587,

per lineal foot (4.37 kN/m).  The existing foundation need not be checked to
resist the additional forces induced by the system of secondary anchors;
however, the existing foundation shall be evaluated as specified in LAMC
Subsection 91.9406.11.



 



91.9406.5.  Design of Anchorage.

accordance to the provisions of CBC Chapter 23.  Secondary diaphragm anchors
as specified in LAMC Subsection 91.9406.4 may be developed through existing 2
inch (50.8 mm) nominal width framing members.  The effects of eccentricity
on wood members shall be evaluated as required per LAMC Subdivision

and compression forces.  Seismic forces shall not induce flexural stresses
in any member of the frame, in diaphragm struts, or in the collectors. 
Where existing anchor bolts are used for anchorage, existing confinement
shall be verified and additional confinement provided where necessary.  When
the braced frame is not rectangular, distribution of forces to members shall
account for the variations in slope.

SEC. 91.9501.  PURPOSE.



 



   The purpose of this division is to promote the public welfare and
safety by reducing the risk of death or injury that may result from the
effects of earthquakes on existing concrete buildings.  In the Northridge
Earthquake, many concrete buildings constructed prior to the 1976 Los Angeles
City Building Code provisions performed poorly and collapsed, causing loss of
human life, personal injury and property damage.  Similar loss of life,
injury and property damage occurred in the Great Hanshin Earthquake, Mexico
City Earthquake, and Christchurch New Zealand Earthquake due to the outdated
building codes in those communities.  The poor performance of these older
concrete buildings is typically due to deficiencies in the lateral force
resisting system (beams, columns and joints) that render the building
incapable of sustaining gravity loads when the building is subjected to
earthquake-induced lateral displacements.  This division creates minimum
standards to mitigate hazards from these structural deficiencies.  Adherence
to these minimum standards will improve the performance of these buildings
during earthquakes and reduce, but not necessarily prevent, the loss of life,
injury or earthquake-related damage.



 



 



SEC. 91.9502.  SCOPE.



 



   The provisions of this division shall apply to any existing concrete
building built pursuant to a permit application for a new building that was
submitted before January 13, 1977, or, if no permit can be located, the
structure is determined by the Department to have been built under building
code standards enacted before January 13, 1977.



 



   EXCEPTIONS:  This division shall not apply to detached single-family
dwellings or detached duplexes.  Moreover, notwithstanding any provision of
this Code, compliance with this division shall not require existing
electrical, plumbing, mechanical or fire-safety systems to be altered to
comply with existing code unless they constitute a hazard to life or property.

SEC. 91.9601.  PURPOSE.



   (Added by Ord. No. 171,261, Eff. 8/30/96.)



 



   The purpose of this division is to promote public safety and welfare by
reducing the risk of death or injury that may result from the effects of
earthquakes on reinforced concrete and masonry wall buildings with flexible
diaphragms designed under the building codes in effect prior to January 1,
1995. These buildings are potentially hazardous and prone to significant
damage, including possible collapse, in a moderate to major earthquake. These
structures typically shelter large numbers of persons and property for
retail, food markets, food distribution centers, warehousing, aerospace,
industrial/manufacturing and general business and office use. Their continued
use after an earthquake is also essential to the local economy and its
post-earthquake recovery.



 



   The provisions of this division are minimum standards for structural
seismic resistance established primarily to reduce the risk of loss of life
or injury on both subject and adjacent properties and will not necessarily
prevent all earthquake damage to an existing building which complies with
these standards. This division shall not require existing electrical,
plumbing, mechanical or fire-safety systems to be altered unless they
constitute a hazard to life or property.



 



   This division provides voluntary retrofit standards for deficient wall
anchorage systems on structures that are not subject to the mandatory
provisions of Division 91, Article 1, Chapter IX of the LAMC.  When fully
followed, these standards will strengthen the portion of the structure that
is most vulnerable to earthquake damage.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff.
7/16/18.)

buildings of the following types:



 



   1.   Cast-in-place reinforced concrete or masonry wall buildings
with flexible diaphragms designed under building codes in effect prior to
January 1, 1995.



 



   2.   Tilt-up concrete wall buildings with flexible diaphragms
designed under the building codes in effect prior to January 1, 1995, but
after January 1, 1976.



 



   All tilt-up concrete wall buildings designed under the Building Code in
effect prior to January 1, 1976, are subject to the mandatory provisions of
Division 91, Article 1, Chapter IX of the LAMC.  All existing reinforced
masonry or concrete buildings with flexible diaphragms, including tilt-up
concrete wall buildings, designed under the Building Code in effect on or
after January 1, 1995, shall be designed in conformance with Division 16,
Article 1, Chapter IX of the LAMC.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff.
7/16/18.)



 



 



SEC. 91.9603.  DEFINITIONS.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)



 



   For the purposes of this division, the applicable definitions in CBC
Sections 1602, 1613.2, 1902 and 2302; ASCE 7 Sections 1.2, 3.1, 4.1 and 11.2;
and the following shall apply:



 



   ANCHORAGE SYSTEM is the system of all structural elements and
connections, which support the concrete or masonry wall in the lateral
direction, including diaphragms and subdiaphragms, wall anchorage and
continuity or cross tie connectors in subdiaphragms and main diaphragms.



 



   COMMENCED CONSTRUCTION is construction pursuant to a valid building
permit that has progressed to the point that one of the called inspections as
required by the Department has been made and the work for which the
inspection has been called has been judged by the Department to be
substantial and has been approved by the Department.



 



   EXISTING BUILDING is an erected building for which a legal building
permit and a certificate of occupancy have been issued.



 



   FLEXIBLE DIAPHRAGM is any diaphragm constructed of wood structural
panel, diagonal or straight wood sheathing, metal decking without a

resisting system of an existing building by alteration of existing or
addition of new structural elements.



 



   TILT-UP CONCRETE WALL is a form of precast concrete panel construction
either cast in the horizontal position at the site and after curing, lifted
and moved into place in a vertical position, or cast off-site in a
fabricator’s shop.



 



 



SEC. 91.9604.  ANALYSIS AND DESIGN.



   (Added by Ord. No. 171,261, Eff. 8/30/96.)



 



91.9604.1.  Wall Panel Anchorage.  (Amended by Ord. No. 181,758, Eff.
8/8/11.)  Concrete and masonry walls shall be anchored to all floors and
roofs which provide lateral support for the wall.  The anchorage shall
provide a positive direct connection between the wall and floor or roof
construction capable of resisting a horizontal force equal to 30 percent of
the tributary wall weight for all buildings, and 45 percent of the tributary
wall weight for essential buildings, or a minimum force of 250 pounds per
linear foot of wall, whichever is greater.



 



   EXCEPTION:  Using 75% of the design force as specified in Section
12.11 of ASCE 7 and completely complying with all the requirements as
specified in Section 12.11 of ASCE 7 is considered equivalent to the
requirements specified in this LAMC section and LAMC Subsection 91.9604.2. 
(Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)



 



   The required anchorage shall be based on the tributary wall panel
assuming simple supports at floors and roof.



 



   EXCEPTION: An alternate design may be approved by the Superintendent of
Building when justified by well established principles of mechanics.



 



91.9604.2.  Special Requirements for Wall Anchors and Continuity Ties. 
(Amended by Ord. No. 181,758, Eff. 8/8/11.)  The steel elements of the wall
anchorage systems and continuity ties shall be designed by the allowable
stress design method using a load factor of 1.7.  The 1/3 stress increase
permitted by CBC Section 1605.3.1.1 shall not be permitted for materials
using allowable stress design methods.



 



   The strength design specified in CBC Section 1912, using a load factor
of 2.0 in lieu of 1.4 for earthquake loading, shall be used for the design of
embedment in concrete.



 



   Wall anchors shall be provided to resist out-of-plane forces,
independent of existing shear anchors.



 



   EXCEPTION: Existing cast-in-place shear anchors may be used as wall
anchors if the tie element can be readily attached to the anchors and if the
engineer or architect can establish tension values for the existing anchors
through the use of approved as-built plans or testing, and through analysis
showing that the bolts are capable of resisting the total shear load while
being acted upon by the maximum tension force due to seismic loading. 
Criteria for analysis and testing shall be determined by the Superintendent
of Building.



 



   Expansion anchors are not allowed without special approval of the
Superintendent of Building.  Attaching the edge of plywood sheathing to
steel ledgers is not considered as complying with the positive anchoring
requirements of the Code; and attaching the edge of steel decks to steel
ledgers is not considered as providing the positive anchorage of this Code
unless testing and analysis are performed, which establish shear values for
the attachment perpendicular to the edge of the deck.



 



91.9604.3.  Development of Anchor Loads into the Diaphragm.  (Amended by
Ord. No. 182,850, Eff. 1/3/14.)  Development of anchor loads into roof and
floor diaphragms shall comply with Section 12.11 of ASCE 7.



 



   EXCEPTION: If continuously tied girders are present, then the maximum
spacing of the continuity ties is the greater of the girder spacing or 24
feet (7315 mm).



 



   In wood diaphragms, anchorage shall not be accomplished by use of toe
nails or nails subject to withdrawal, nor shall wood ledgers, top plates or
framing be used in cross-grain bending or cross-grain tension.  The
continuous ties required by LAMC Subsection 91.1613.5.3 and Section 12.11 of
ASCE 7 shall be in addition to the diaphragm sheathing. (Amended by Ord. No.
185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)



 



   Lengths of development of anchor loads in wood diaphragms shall be
based on existing field nailing of the sheathing unless existing edge nailing
is positively identified on the original construction plans or at the site.



 



   At reentrant corners, continuity collectors may be required for
existing return walls not designed as shear walls, to develop into the
diaphragm a force equal to the lesser of the rocking or shear capacity of the
return wall, or the tributary shear but not exceeding the capacity of the
diaphragm.  Shear anchors for the return wall shall be commensurate with the
collector force.  If a truss or beam other than rafters or purlins is
supported by the return wall or by a column integral with the return wall, an
independent secondary column is required to support the roof or floor members
whenever rocking or shear capacity of the return wall is governing.



 



91.9604.4.  Anchorage at Pilasters.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff.
7/16/18.)  Anchorage of pilasters shall be designed for the tributary wall
anchoring load per LAMC Subsection 91.9604.1, considering the wall as a
two-way slab. The edge of the two-way slab shall be considered "fixed" when
there is continuity at pilasters, and considered "pinned" at roof or floor
levels.  The pilasters or the walls immediately adjacent to the pilasters
shall be anchored directly to the roof framing such that the existing
vertical anchor bolts at the top of the pilasters are by-passed without
causing tension or shear failure at the top of the pilasters.



 



   EXCEPTION:  If existing vertical anchor bolts at the top of the
pilasters are used for the anchorage, then additional exterior confinement
shall be provided.



 



   The minimum anchorage at a floor or roof between the pilasters shall be
that specified in LAMC Subsection 91.9604.1.



 



91.9604.5.  Symmetry.  Symmetry of connectors in the anchorage system is
required.  Eccentricity may be allowed when it can be shown that all
components of forces are positively resisted and justified by calculations or
tests.



 



91.9604.6.  Minimum Roof Member Size.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff.
7/16/18.)  Wood members used to develop anchorage forces to the diaphragm
shall be of minimum three-inch nominal width for new construction and
replacement.  All such members must be designed for gravity and earthquake
forces as part of the wall anchorage system.  For existing structural
members, the allowable stresses shall be without the 1/3 stress increase per
LAMC Subsection 91.9604.2.



 



91.9604.7.  Combination of Anchor Types.  To repair and retrofit existing
buildings, a combination of different anchor types of different behavior or
stiffness shall not be permitted.  The capacity of the new and existing
connectors cannot be added.



 



91.9604.8.  Prohibited Anchors.  Usage of connectors that were bent or
stretched from the intended use shall be prohibited.



 



91.9604.9.  Crack and Damage Repairs, Evaluation of Existing Structural
Alterations.  The engineer or architect shall report any observed structural
conditions and structural damage that have imminent life safety effects on
the buildings and recommend repairs.  This includes alterations such as
openings cut in existing wall panels without a building permit.  Evaluations
and repairs shall be reviewed and approved by the Department.



 



91.9604.10.  Miscellaneous.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.) 
Existing mezzanines relying on the concrete or masonry walls for vertical or
lateral support shall be anchored to the walls for the tributary mezzanine
load.  Walls depending on the mezzanine for lateral support shall be
anchored per LAMC Subsections 91.9604.1, 91.9604.2 and 91.9604.3.



 



   EXCEPTION:  Existing mezzanines that have independent lateral and
vertical support need not be anchored to the concrete or masonry walls.



 



   Existing interior masonry or concrete walls not designed as shear
walls, which extend to the floor above or to the roof diaphragm shall also be
anchored for out-of-plane forces per LAMC Subsections 91.9604.1, 91.9604.2
and 91.9604.3.  In the in-plane direction, the walls may be isolated or
shall be developed into the diaphragm for a lateral force equal to the lesser
of the rocking or shear capacity of the wall, or the tributary shear but not
exceeding the diaphragm capacity.



 



91.9604.11.  Historical Buildings.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff.
7/16/18.)  Qualified historical buildings shall be permitted to use
alternate building standards or deviations from this division in order to
preserve their original or restored architectural elements and features. 
See LAMC Section 91.2.1200 for these alternatives.



 



 



SEC. 91.9605.  MATERIALS OF CONSTRUCTION.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)



 



   All materials permitted by this Code, including their appropriate
allowable stresses and those existing configurations of materials specified
in Division 88, Article 1, Chapter IX of the LAMC, may be utilized to meet
the requirements of this division.

   Replacement, Retention and Extension of Original Materials.  The
replacement, retention and extension of original materials, and the use of
original methods of construction, for any building or accessory structure may
remain, provided the aggregate value of work in any one year does not exceed
10% of the replacement value, and provided further that no hazardous
conditions exist and provided such building or structure complied with the
building code provisions in effect at the time of original construction and
the building or accessory structure does not become or continue to be a
substandard building.  Local ordinances or regulations shall permit the
replacement, retention and extension of original materials, and the use of
original methods of construction, for any building or accessory structure,
provided such building or structure complied with the building code
provisions in effect at the time of original construction and the building or

   EXCEPTION:  Replacement, retention and extension of unreinforced
masonry wall is not permitted.



 



   Alteration, repair or rehabilitation of the existing portion in excess
of 10% of the replacement value of a building or structure may be made
provided that all the work conforms to this Code for a new building and that
no hazardous condition or substandard building is continued or created in the
remainder of the building as a result of such work.



 



91.2.401.6.  Maintenance.  Buildings and structures, and parts thereof,
shall be maintained in a safe and sanitary condition.  Devices or safeguards
which are required by the CBC and this Code shall be maintained in
conformance with the code edition under which installed.  The owner or the
owner's designated agent shall be responsible for the maintenance of
buildings and structures.  To determine compliance with this subsection, the
Department shall have the authority to require a building or structure to be
reinspected.  The requirements of this division shall not provide the basis
for removal or abrogation of fire protection and safety systems and devices
in existing structures.  Maintenance of buildings and structures shall
comply with Divisions 81 and 86 of Chapter IX of the LAMC.



 



91.2.401.7.  Compliance.  (Added by Ord. No. 185,198, Eff. 11/22/17.) 
Alterations, repairs, additions and changes of occupancy to, or relocation
of, existing structure shall comply with the provisions for alterations,
repairs, additions and changes of occupancy in the Los Angeles Fire Code, Los
Angeles Mechanical Code, Los Angeles Plumbing Code, Los Angeles Residential
Code and Los Angeles Electrical Code.



 



   Where there are different requirements in this Code, the most
restrictive requirement shall govern.  Where there is a conflict between a
general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement
shall be applicable.



 



91.2.402.4.  Existing Structural Elements Carrying Lateral Load.  Where the
addition is structurally independent of the existing structure, existing
lateral load-carrying structural elements shall be permitted to remain
unaltered.  Where the addition is not structurally independent of the
existing structure, the existing structure and its addition acting together
as a single structure shall be shown to meet the requirements of CBC Sections
1609 and 1613.  For purposes of CEBC Section 402, compliance with ASCE 41,
using a Tier 3 procedure and the two level performance objective in CEBC
Table 301.1.4.1 for the applicable risk category, shall be deemed to meet the
requirements of CBC Section 1613, with procedures established by the
Department.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,198, Eff. 11/22/17.)



 



   EXCEPTION:  Except for Unreinforced Masonry (URM) Buildings, any
existing lateral load-carrying structural element whose demand-capacity ratio
with the addition considered is no more than 10% greater than its
demand-capacity ratio with the addition ignored shall be permitted to remain
unaltered.  For purposes of calculating demand-capacity ratios, the demand
shall consider applicable load combinations with design lateral loads or
forces in accordance with CBC Sections 1609 and 1613.  For purposes of this
exception, comparisons of demand-capacity ratios and calculations of design
lateral loads, forces and capacities shall account for the cumulative effects
of additions and alterations since original construction.



 



   Unreinforced Masonry (URM) Buildings:



 



   Any existing lateral load-carrying structural element on an
unreinforced masonry building whose demand-capacity ratio with the addition
considered less than 10% greater than its demand-capacity ratio with the
addition, must comply with CEBC Appendix Chapter A1.  When the
demand-capacity ratio with the addition considered is 10% or greater than its
demand-capacity ratio with the addition ignored, shall be designed per CBC
Division 16.



 



91.2.403.4.  Existing Structural Elements Carrying Lateral Load.  Where the
alteration increases design lateral loads in accordance with CBC Section 1609
or 1613, or where the alteration results in a prohibited structural
irregularity as defined in ASCE 7, or where the alteration decreases the
capacity of any existing lateral load-carrying structural element, the
structure of the altered building or structure shall be shown to meet the
requirements of CBC Sections 1609 and 1613.  For purposes of CEBC Section
403, compliance with ASCE 41, using a Tier 3 procedure and the two level
performance objective in CEBC Table 301.1.4.1 for the applicable risk
category, shall be deemed to meet the requirements of CBC Section 1613, with
procedures established by the Department.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,198,
Eff. 11/22/17.)



 



   EXCEPTION:  Except for Unreinforced Masonry Buildings (URM), any
existing lateral load-carrying structural element whose demand-capacity ratio
with the alteration considered is no more than 10% greater than its
demand-capacity ratio with the alteration ignored shall be permitted to
remain unaltered.  For purposes of calculating demand-capacity ratios, the
demand shall consider applicable load combinations with design lateral loads
or forces in accordance with CBC Sections 1609 and 1613.  For purposes of
this exception, comparisons of demand-capacity ratios and calculations of
design lateral loads, forces and capacities shall account for the cumulative
effects of additions and alterations since original construction.



 



   Unreinforced Masonry (URM) Buildings:



 



   Any existing lateral load-carrying structural element on an URM
building whose demand-capacity ratio with the addition considered less than
10% greater than its demand-capacity ratio with the addition, must comply
with CEBC Appendix Chapter A1.  When the demand-capacity ratio with the
addition considered is 10% or greater than its demand-capacity ratio with the
addition ignored, it shall be designed per CBC Chapter 16.




   Structural analysis per CEBC Appendix Chapter A1 is required for any
alterations to crosswalls or diaphragms.



 



91.2.407.4.  Structural.  When a change of occupancy results in a structure
being reclassified to a higher risk category, the structure shall conform to
the seismic requirements for a new structure of the higher risk category. 
For purposes of CEBC Section 407, compliance with ASCE 41, using a Tier 3
procedure and the two level performance objective in CEBC Table 301.1.4.1 for
the applicable risk category, shall be deemed to meet the requirements of CBC
Section 1613, with procedures established by the Department.  (Amended by
Ord. No. 185,198, Eff. 11/22/17.)



 



   EXCEPTIONS:



 



   1.   Specific seismic detailing requirements of CBC Section 1613 for
a new structure shall not be required to be met where the seismic performance
is shown to be equivalent to that of a new structure.  A demonstration of
equivalence shall consider the regularity, overstrength, redundancy and
ductility of the structure.



 



   2.   When a change of use results in a structure being reclassified
from Risk Category I or II to Risk Category III and the structure is located
where the seismic coefficient, SDS, is less than 0.33, compliance with the
seismic requirements of CBC Section 1613 is not required.



 



   For a change of occupancy of an existing commercial or industrial
building to residential use, all existing buildings shall be analyzed for 75%
of the design earthquake ground motion, as defined in CBC Section 1613.5, but
in no event shall there be a reduction in the capacity of the seismic force
resisting system where that system provides a greater level of protection
than the minimum requirements established by this Code.



 



   For an existing URM building, structural analysis per CBC Chapter 16 is
required if the risk category is changed to III or IV.  Structural analysis
per CEBC Appendix A1 is required if rating classification per LABC Division
88, Table 88-A is changed to I or II.



 



   For URM buildings with an approved occupant load greater than 100, the
occupant load may be increased by a maximum of 10% without changing the
rating class or risk category.



 



   The most restrictive requirement of CBC Sections 402, 403, 404 and 407
shall apply.



 



91.2.409.1.  Conformance.  Structures moved into or within the City shall
comply with the provisions of Division 83, Article 1, Chapter IX of the LAMC.

91.5.802.8. Lateral Support.  Roof framing members and ceiling joists having
a depth-to-thickness ratio exceeding 2 to 1 based on nominal dimensions shall
be provided with lateral support at points of bearing to prevent rotation. 
For roof rafters with ceiling joists attached per CRC Table R602.3(1), the
depth-thickness ratio for the total assembly shall be determined using the
combined thickness of the rafter plus the attached ceiling joist.  (Amended

not been made.



 



   This provision is not to be interpreted as requiring reinspection fees
the first time a job is rejected for failure to be in accordance with the
requirements of this Code, but as controlling the practice of calling for
inspections before the job is ready for inspection or reinspection.



 



   Reinspection fees shall be permitted to be assessed where the approved
plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure to provide
access on the date for which the inspection is requested, or for deviating
from plans requiring the approval of the Authority Having Jurisdiction.

writing upon a form furnished for that purpose and pay the reinspection fee
in accordance with LAMC Table 103.4.

   EXCEPTION:  An unauthorized fabricator who has filed a complete and
acceptable application and submittal requesting to become an authorized
fabricator and has paid the application fee may submit additional requests
provided:

pay  the supplemental fee in full prior to final action on the application
by the Department.



 



   The fees specified in this section, including supplemental fees, and

Eff. 7/16/18.)  The Superintendent of Building shall investigate every
application submitted pursuant to Subsection (a) of this section to determine
whether the applicant possesses qualifications sufficient to justify the
issuance of the requested approval.  In making this determination the
Superintendent of Building may consider the experience, education and
training of the applicant and his employees; the quality control standards
maintained by the applicant; the equipment and facilities of the applicant;
and the physical plant which will be designated in the requested approval if
the same is issued.  The Superintendent of Building may also consider any
other factors pertaining to the manufacturing processes of the applicant as
he may, in the reasonable exercise of his discretion, deem to be relevant.



 



   (e)   Action Upon Applications.  (Amended by Ord. No. 165,310, Eff.
12/31/89.)  If it is determined that an applicant possesses qualifications
sufficient to justify the issuance of the requested approval, the Department

the application shall be denied and the Department shall notify the applicant
of that action. Such notification shall be in writing and shall specify the
reasons for the denial. Initial applications will expire 12 months after the
filing date if the request for approval of a fabricator has not been cleared
of corrections and approved. No approval shall be issued until the

of the Los Angeles Municipal Code. Such special conditions may include, but
are not limited to, special quality control procedures and requirements for
specific identification of particular materials. Any special conditions
included in an approval shall impose mandatory duties on the fabricator to
comply therewith.



 



   (g)   Rules and Regulations.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff.
7/16/18.)  The Superintendent of Building shall establish such rules and

   (a)   General.  The Superintendent may, from time to time,
promulgate rules and regulations, not in conflict with this Code, governing
the duties, capabilities, and conduct of licensees. Any person violating such
rules and regulations shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. (Amended by Ord. No.
139,419, Eff. 11/30/69.)



 



   (b)   Publishing of Rules and Regulations.  All such rules and
regulations shall be published once in a daily newspaper of general
circulation in the City of Los Angeles, and shall take effect upon
publication, in accordance with applicable regulations.



 



   (c)   Revocation, Suspension or Limitation.  The Superintendent of
Building may, upon his own initiative, or upon the verified complaint in
writing of any person, investigate the action of any licensee, and may
temporarily suspend, for a period not exceeding one year, or revoke his
license for any one or more of the acts or omissions constituting grounds for
disciplinary action provided by LAMC Section 98.0202.  The procedure on
suspension or revocation shall comply with Chapter IX of the LAMC.  (Amended
by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)



 



   (d)   Hearing Available.  In any action to suspend, revoke, limit,
or refuse the renewal of any license, a hearing by the Board shall be
available to the licensee as set forth and in the manner specifically
provided for in Article 8, Chapter IX of the LAMC.  (Amended by Ord. No.
185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)



 



   (e)   New Application After Denial or Revocation.  When any license
is revoked for cause, no new or other application for a similar license from
the same applicant shall be accepted within one year after such revocation.
When an application for renewal of a license is denied for cause, no new or
other application shall be accepted within one year after denial unless the
applicant can show a material change in his situation which would justify the
issuance.



 



   (f)   Special Renewal Provisions for Service in Armed Forces. 
Whenever, under Chapter IX of the LAMC, a person who previously held a
license applies for a renewal thereof and shows to the satisfaction of the
Superintendent of Building that his failure to renew such license within the
time provided herein resulted from his induction or entrance into the armed
forces of the United States or of any allied nation, and that the application
for renewal is made within six months after the applicant's honorable
discharge from the service, his application shall be deemed an application
for renewal and the renewal fee only shall be charged therefor.  (Amended by
Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)



 



   (g)   Lapse or Suspension – Jurisdiction of the Department.  The
lapse or suspension of a license by operation of law, or the voluntary
surrender of such, shall not deprive the Department of jurisdiction to
proceed with any investigation of, or disciplinary proceedings against, the
licensee, or to render a decision denying, suspending or revoking his
license. (Amended by Ord. No. 139,419, Eff. 11/30/69.)



 



   (h)   Prior Acts No Bar to Department Action. The Department may
take disciplinary action against a licensee as provided in Article 8, Chapter
IX of the LAMC even though the grounds for disciplinary action arose prior to
the granting of the license.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)

SEC. 98.0303.  ACCUSATION RE SUSPENSION OR REVOCATION OF LICENSES OR PERMITS.



 



   (a)   Contents.  Whenever a hearing is required or available by
this Code to determine whether a license as defined herein should be revoked
suspended, limited or conditioned, such hearing shall be initiated by filing
an accusation. The accusation shall be verified unless made by a public
officer acting in his official capacity or by a duly appointed representative
of the Department. The verification may be on information and belief.
(Amended by Ord. No. 139,419, Eff. 11/30/69.)



 



   (b)   Service.  Upon the filing of an accusation, the
Superintendent shall serve a copy thereof on the respondent. (Amended by Ord.
No. 139,419, Eff. 11/30/69.)



 



   (c)   Method of Service.  The accusation may be served on the
respondent personally or by registered or certified mail.



 



   (d)   Proof of Service – Time of Taking Effect.  Service by
registered mail shall be effective on the date of mailing, if a registered
letter containing the accusation is mailed, postage prepaid, addressed to the
respondent at the latest address on file with the Department, or as known by
the City Clerk. (Amended by Ord. No. 139,419, Eff. 11/30/69.)



 



   (e)   Appearance – Objections to Service Waived.  Where a
respondent files a notice of defense or otherwise appears in a proceeding,
all objections to the validity of service shall be deemed waived.



 



   (f)   Instructions With Accusation.  The copy of the accusation
shall include or be accompanied by a statement that respondent may request a
hearing by filing a notice of defense as provided hereinafter within ten days
after service upon him of the accusation, and that failure to do so will
constitute a waiver of his right to a hearing. A postcard or other form,
entitled “Notice of Defense,” shall be included with the accusation,
which, when signed by or on behalf of the respondent and returned to the
Department, will acknowledge service of the accusation and constitute a
notice of defense as provided for hereinafter.  (Amended by Ord. No.
139,419, Eff. 11/30/69.)



 



 



SEC. 98.0304.  NOTICE OF DEFENSE TO ACCUSATION.



 



   (a)   Form and Purpose.  Within ten days after service upon him of
the accusation, the respondent may file one or more notices of defense in
which he may:  request a hearing; object to the accusation upon the ground
that it does not state acts or omissions upon which the Department may
proceed; object to the form of the accusation on the ground that it is so
indefinite or uncertain that he cannot identify the transaction or prepare
his defense; admit the accusation in whole or in part. (Amended by Ord. No.
139,419, Eff. 11/30/69.)



 



   (b)   Failure to File Notice of Defense – Waiver.  The respondent
shall be entitled to a hearing on the merits if he files a notice of defense
within ten days, and any such notice shall be deemed a specific denial of all
parts of the accusation not expressly admitted. Failure to file such notice
shall constitute a waiver of respondent’s right to a hearing, but the
Department, in its discretion, may nevertheless conduct a hearing. Unless
objection is taken as provided in this section, all objections to the form of
the accusation shall be deemed waived.  (Amended by Ord. No. 139,419, Eff.
11/30/69.)



 



   (c)   Written Notice of Defense.  The notice of defense shall be in
writing signed by or on behalf of the respondent and shall state his mailing
address. It must be verified but need not follow any particular form.



 



   (d)   Amendment of Accusation.  At any time before the matter is
submitted for decision, the Board, Superintendent or hearing examiner may
order or permit the filing of an amended or supplemental accusation. All
parties shall be notified thereof. If the amended or supplemental accusation
presents new charges, the respondent shall be afforded a reasonable
opportunity to prepare a defense thereto. Any new charges shall be deemed
controverted and any objections to the amended or supplemental accusation may
be made orally and shall be noted in the record.  (Amended by Ord. No.
139,419, Eff. 11/30/69.)

written waiver of time and request an immediate hearing.  (Amended by Ord.
No. 139,419, Eff. 11/30/69.)

   The Board, Superintendent or hearing examiner may order amendment of
the accusation after submission of the case for decision. Each party shall be
given notice of the intended amendment and opportunity to show that he will
be prejudiced thereby unless the case is reopened to permit the introduction
of additional evidence in his behalf. If such prejudice is shown, the Board,
Superintendent or hearing examiner shall reopen the case to permit the
introduction of additional evidence.

may obtain the issuance and service of a subpoena for the attendance of a
witness or the production of other evidence at a hearing or upon the written
demand of any party. The issuance and service of such subpoena shall be
obtained upon the filing of an affidavit therefor which states the name and
address of the proposed witness; specifies the exact things sought to be
produced and the materiality thereof in detail to the issues involved; and
states that the witness has the desired things in his possession or under his
control. A subpoena need not be issued when the affidavit is defective in any

   (d)   Admissibility of Evidence.  Any relevant evidence shall be
admitted if it is the type of evidence on which responsible persons are

admission of such evidence over objection in civil actions.

cross-examination.



 



   (h)   Testimony at Direction of Board, Superintendent or Examiner.

accusation, or fails to file a notice of defense or fails to appear at the
hearing, the Superintendent may take action based on the respondent’s
express admissions or upon other evidence, including official reports, except

entitled to the action sought, the Superintendent may act without taking
evidence. Nothing herein shall be construed to deprive the respondent of the
right to make any showing by way of mitigation.  (Amended by Ord. No.

   Any person engaged in the business of selling, installing or
constructing equipment or appliances for which a permit is required under
Chapter IX of the LAMC, shall keep written permanent records of all such
installations, showing the permit number and date, the address of the place
where equipment was installed, the type of installation, and the name of the
owner for whom such installation was made.  The Superintendent of Building,
or his duly authorized representative, shall have the power to examine, at
any reasonable hour, all necessary books and records of any such person for
the purpose of ascertaining whether or not permits have been secured for
selling, installing or constructing equipment or appliances as required under
Chapter IX of the LAMC.



 



 



SEC. 98.0402.  CODE ENFORCEMENT COSTS INCURRED:  INVESTIGATION COSTS, FEES

commenced without authorization by a permit or application for inspection,
and that work violates any provision of Articles 1 through 8 of Chapter IX of
the LAMC, and if no order has been issued by the Department or a court of law
requiring said work to proceed, a special investigation shall be made prior
to the issuance of any permit, license or application for inspection.



 



   An Investigation Fee, which shall be double the amount charged for an
application for inspection, license or permit fee, shall be collected on each
permit, license or application for inspection so investigated.  The required
investigation fee shall be in addition to any other fees required by Articles
1 through 8 of Chapter IX of the LAMC.  In no event shall the Investigation
Fee be less than $400.00.



 



   The payment of the Investigation Fee shall not exempt any person from
compliance with the provisions of the Code nor from any penalty prescribed by

   (c)   An investigation fee of $15.00 per report shall be charged and

30 days after the date the inspection has been performed and remains
unreported and is in addition to the insurance processing fee.



 



   (d)   Non-Compliance Inspection Fee Required.  See LAMC Section
98.0411.



 



   (e)   Annual Inspection Fee. Whenever the Department makes annual
inspections pursuant to LAMC Sections 12.26 F.3., 12.26 I.5. and 13.03 (or
any other provision of this Code) the Department shall collect a fee from the
property owner or business operator for inspection of each "recycling center"
and "yard" business as defined in LAMC Section 12.26 F.1., each "automotive
repair garage" and "used vehicle sales area" business as defined in LAMC
Section 12.26 I.1., and each "surface mining (operation)" as defined in LAMC

   (a)   Powers of the Department.

Department is granted the power to enforce all ordinances and laws relating

   3.   (Amended by Ord. No. 173,159, Eff. 5/7/00, Oper. 7/1/00.)  The
Department is granted the power to enforce the zoning ordinances of the City.

shall have the power and duty to enforce all ordinances and laws relating to
grading and control of excessive dust emission.



 



   5.   The Department shall have the power and duty to enforce all
portions of the Rules and Regulations of the State Fire Marshal which relate

provisions of the Rules and Regulations of the State Fire Marshal shall be
granted by the Department, unless and until such application shall be first
submitted to the Chief Engineer of the Fire Department or his representative
for report and recommendation with respect thereto.



 



   6.   The Department shall have the power to enforce those building
regulations mandated by State or Federal law to be enforced by the local
building Department or building official.



 



   7.   The Department shall have the power to enforce States laws
relating to buildings, structures and construction activities provided the
authority to do so has been allowed or granted by the State and the
Department has determined to undertake such enforcement.



 



   8.   The Department shall have the power to enforce other ordinances
and laws when designated to do so by law.



 



   9.   In the exercise of the powers enumerated in this subsection,
the Department shall have the power to apply the building ordinances of the
City (Chapter IX of the LAMC) and those building regulations mandated by
state law to be enforced by the local agency, building Department or Building
Official to buildings and structures containing one or more air space lots as
defined in Article 2, Chapter I of the LAMC so as to treat the entirety of
such buildings or structures as if they were on or within a single lot,
provided:  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)



 



   i.   That such buildings or structures or portions thereof would
otherwise conform to such ordinances and regulations, but for the creation of
such air space lots; and



 



   ii.   That a covenant and agreement, in a form designed to run with
the land and satisfactory to the Department be recorded with the Office of
the County Recorder and a copy filed with the Department by the owners
binding themselves and future owners and assigns to keep, preserve and
maintain all portions of such buildings or structures in accordance with and
pursuant to such building ordinances and regulations.



 



   10.   (Amended by Ord. No. 170,141, Eff. 1/2/95.)  The Department
shall have the power to hear and act upon requests for slight modifications
in individual cases to the building ordinances of the City, and regulations
under Articles 1 through 8 of Chapter IX of the Los Angeles Municipal Code.



 



   In granting a request for a slight modification, the Department shall
determine that the slight modification is reasonably equivalent to the
ordinance requirement involved, that a special individual reason makes the
strict letter of the ordinance impractical and that the slight modification
is in conformity with the spirit and purpose of the code or codes involved.



 



   11.   (Added by Ord. No. 170,141, Eff. 1/2/95.)  The Department
shall have the power to hear and determine requests for slight modifications
for individual cases in the yard area requirements of the zoning ordinance,
provided that in each such modification, the Superintendent shall first find
that a special, individual reason makes the strict letter of the ordinance
impractical and that the modification is in conformity with the spirit and
purpose of the ordinance involved.  Any action granting a modification shall
be recorded and entered in the files of the Department.



 



   For structures and additions constructed after January 1, 1995, slight
modifications from the yard requirements shall be limited to deviations
permitting portions of buildings to extend into a required yard or other open
space a distance of not to exceed 20 percent of the width or depth of such
required yard or open space.  However, for structures and additions existing
prior to January 1, 1995, slight modifications may be granted for yard
deviations slightly over 20 percent.



 



   Except as expressly provided herein, the Superintendent of Building
shall not grant deviations from the lot area, height, or density
requirements.  Further, the Superintendent shall not grant deviations from
the yard requirements relating to the height of fences and walls, or
including those for tennis or paddle tennis courts and other game courts.



 



   If the yard regulations cannot reasonably be complied with or it is
difficult to determine their application on lots of peculiar shape or
location, then the regulations may be modified or determined by the
Superintendent of Building.  The Superintendent may also waive all or part
of the required loading space on unusually shaped lots, oddly located lots,
or hillside lots, when such space cannot reasonably be provided or utilized.



 



   Requests for yard modifications as provided in this subsection shall be
made in accordance with the procedures established in Section 98.0403.2 of
the Los Angeles Municipal Code.



 



   12.   (Amended by Ord. No. 173,364, Eff. 7/29/00.)  The Department
shall have the power to enforce any administrative nuisance abatement
determination made by the Zoning Administrator, former Board of Zoning
Appeals, City Planning Commission, Director of Planning or City Council. 
There shall be no administrative appeal to any City official or Board from
such an enforcement action by the Department.

have the power to hear and act upon appeals filed by any person aggrieved by
the Department requesting a slight modification under this section, except
for those actions permitted in subsection (a)11.



 



   If the Board grants a slight modification on appeal, then the Board
shall make the same findings as required by the Department when acting on a
slight modification.



 



   2.   (Amended by Ord. No. 175,428, Eff. 9/28/03.)  The Board shall
have the power to hear and determine appeals from orders, interpretations,
requirements, determinations, or actions of the Department pertaining to
enforcement of specific ordinances, regulations, or laws in site-specific
cases.  These appeals shall state how the Department has erred or abused its
discretion in the matter of the appeal.  The Department shall provide the
Board with a written report on the appeal.  The Department, however, may
reverse or modify the action appealed at any time prior to final action by
the Commission.  The Board shall hear and make its determination on the
appeal no later than the 30th calendar day after the appeal is heard.



 



   Notwithstanding the above, the Board shall have no authority to hear
and determine appeals from orders, interpretations, requirements,
determinations, or actions of the Department pertaining to enforcement of
specific ordinances, regulations, or laws contained in Chapter I of the LAMC
and in other land use ordinances.  Any appeal concerning these requirements
shall be made to the Director of Planning in accordance with the provisions
set forth in LAMC Section 12.26 K.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff.
7/16/18.)



 



   The Department shall maintain a file of requests from individuals or
groups who wish to be notified of certain determinations on individual job
addresses.  These requests shall be submitted to the Department in writing
and shall specify the subject job address, and the address and telephone
number where they wish to be notified.  The request shall be in force until
the end of the calendar year in which the request is filed and the request
may be renewed at any time during the subsequent calendar year.



 



   The Department shall provide a copy of board agendas by U.S. mail to
individuals or groups who wish to receive them.  The mailing of agendas
shall be maintained by a yearly subscription fee of $50.00.  A subscription
fee of $25.00 will be charged if there is less than six months remaining in
the calendar year.  Fees for individual and/or mail requests for copies of
board agendas and other documents shall be as set forth in Los Angeles
Administrative Code Sections 12.31 and 12.32.



 



   3.   The Board shall have the power to act in other situations as
provided by ordinance or law.



 



   4.   The Board shall have the power to refuse to hear an appeal if
the Board determines that the appeal is basically a restatement of a previous
appeal on the same job and no substantial additional justification has been
presented by the appellant.



 



   5.   The power of the Board shall not include the right to hear and
act upon any of the following:



 



   i.   An appeal from the Department’s action on a request for a
slight modification, an appeal of a legitimate Department order or an appeal
objecting to the Department’s determination, if such appeal is:



 



   a)  Filed on or after the date a citation is issued charging a person
with a violation of the Code or any other ordinance or law enforced by the
Department, and the appeal in any way involves the citation issuance, an
arrest associated with the citation issuance, or the facts or Code issues
underlying the citation issuance.



 



   b)  (Amended by Ord. No. 170,324, Eff. 3/6/95.)  Filed on or after
evidence of a violation of the Code or any other ordinance or law enforced by
the Department is presented to and accepted by the City Attorney for criminal
prosecution.



 



   If an appeal or request for a slight modification is not filed with 15
days after the Department’s action on the violation, the action and/or
determination of the Department shall be final.



 



   ii.   An appeal in violation of limitations placed upon the
Board’s powers as specified in other ordinances, regulations, or law.



 



   iii.   (Repealed by Ord. No. 175,428, Eff. 9/28/03.)



 



   iv.   If the Board or Superintendent determines that an appeal or
request for a slight modification, filed with the Board, relates to
Department enforcement of laws or access to public accommodations and housing
by the physically handicapped, then the matter shall be referred to the
Handicapped Access Appeals Commission for its action. The Board’s
jurisdiction shall not include the right to hear appeals from or otherwise
review any action, order, or determination of the Handicapped Access Appeals
Commission.



 



   v.   (Amended by Ord. No. 173,159, Eff. 5/7/00, Oper. 7/1/00.)  An
appeal dealing with financial, personnel, or administrative issues or other
similar matters.

seeking relief from any nuisance abatement determination or enforcement
decision of the Department relating to any administrative nuisance abatement
determination made by the Zoning Administrator, former Board of Zoning
Appeals, City Planning Commission, Director of Planning or City Council.

Department processing the appeal and making a determination.



 



   In addition to the appeal processing fee required above, an inspection
fee of $84.00 per inspection shall be paid by the appellant when, in the
opinion of the Department, the appeal requires field inspections to verify
site conditions.  Miscellaneous Fees as provided for in LAMC Section
98.0415(f) may be collected to prepare a written report.



 



   An additional inspection fee as described in LAMC Section 98.0412(a)
may be charged by the Department for each inspection necessary to verify
compliance with the conditions established by the determination of the
Department.



 



   EXCEPTIONS:



 



   A.   No appeal fee shall be required on any appeal from an order

   3.   If the Superintendent of Building determines that an item of
request involves a material, device or method of construction appropriate for
a General Approval under LAMC Section 98.0501, such request shall be
accompanied by a filing fee of $165.00 for each request submitted which
includes such item.



 



   A supplemental fee as specified in LAMC Section 98.0501(b)4. shall be

the claim made therein, and no request to hold a hearing is pending, the
Department may grant a conditional approval of such request.



 



   4.   In any appeal the appellant making the request shall cause to
be made, at the appellant's own expense, any tests required by the Department

   (a)   There shall be added to the total of all fees imposed for

   (b)   The previous surcharge amount of two percent is increased
solely to pay for the $21.76 million cost of developing and implementing
BuildLA, a comprehensive enterprise wide development services system, and
shall not be used to pay for ongoing BuildLA costs such as maintenance or
system hosting services.

percent or one dollar when the City Administrative Officer determines the

SEC. 98.0411.  NON-COMPLIANCE FEES.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 168,231, Eff. 10/18/92.)



 



   (a)   Noncompliance Fee.  (Amended by Ord. No. 171,175, Eff.
7/25/96.)  If, in the course of enforcing any state law or local ordinance,
the Department issues an order to a person and the person fails to comply
with that order within 15 days following the due date for compliance
specified in the order and any extension thereof, then the Department shall
have the authority to collect a noncompliance fee.



 



   The purpose of this fee is to recover a portion of the cost of any
additional inspection and administrative or appeal proceedings incurred by
the Department  in order to enforce the Code or secure compliance with the
order.  No more than one such fee shall be collected for failure to comply
with an order.  This noncompliance fee shall be in addition to fees
specified elsewhere in the Los Angeles Municipal Code.



 



   The Department shall not impose a noncompliance fee unless the order
states that “a proposed noncompliance fee may be imposed for failure to
comply with the order within 15 days after the compliance date specified in
the order or unless an appeal or slight modification is filled within 15 days
after the compliance date”.



 



   EXCEPTION:  If a person against whom an order is issued appeals that
order within 15 days after the compliance date set forth in the order, then
the Department may not impose a noncompliance fee until a final appeal
determination upholding or modifying the underlying Department order has been
made.  The Department may then impose a noncompliance fee only for failure
to comply with the final appeal determination within 15 days after the
compliance date or dates specified in the determination.



 



   (b)   Appeal.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)  Any
person served with an order and notice of proposed non-compliance fee may
appeal the order and proposed imposition of the non-compliance fee or request
a slight modification pursuant to the procedures set forth in LAMC Section
98.0403.1.



 



   The Department or the Board may rescind or modify the proposed
non-compliance fee under the authority granted by LAMC Section 98.0403.1.



 



   If the appeal or request for slight modification is not filed within 15
days after the compliance date or extensions granted therefrom, the
determination of the Department to impose and collect a non-compliance fee
shall be final.



 



   (c)   Collection of the Noncompliance Fee.  (Amended by Ord. No.
175,596, Eff. 12/7/03.)  If the Department determines pursuant to
Subsections (a) and (b) of this section that a noncompliance fee is due, then
it shall notify the person cited, by United States mail in a sealed envelope,
with postage paid, addressed to the last known address of the person cited as
that address appears in the last equalized assessment roll.  The notice of
noncompliance fee shall state that:



 



   “if the noncompliance fee incurred is not remitted to the Department
within 30 days after the date of mailing of this notice, the Department shall
impose a late charge equal to two times the noncompliance fee and a
collection fee equal to 50 percent of the original noncompliance fee.  Any
person who fails to pay the noncompliance fee, late charge or collection fee
shall also pay interest.  Interest shall be calculated at the rate of one
percent per month, or fraction of a month, on the amount of the noncompliance
fee, late charge and collection fee imposed, from the 60th day after the date
of mailing of this notice until the date of payment.” 



 



   Service of the notice of noncompliance fee shall be deemed to have been
completed at the time of deposit in the United States mail.



 



   The person cited shall remit the noncompliance fee to the Department
within 30 days after the date of mailing the notice of noncompliance fee. 
If the person cited fails to do so, then the Department may demand payment of
the noncompliance fee from the person cited and may withhold the issuance of
building permits, licenses or approvals to the cited person until the
noncompliance fee has been paid.



 



   A late charge equal to two times the noncompliance fee and a collection
fee equal to 50 percent of the original noncompliance fee shall be imposed if
the fee is not paid within 30 days after the date of mailing the notice of
noncompliance fee.  Any person who fails to pay the noncompliance fee, late
charge or collection fee shall also pay interest.  Interest shall be
calculated at the rate of one percent per month, or fraction of a month, on
the amount of the noncompliance fee, late charge and collection fee imposed,
from the 60th day after the date of mailing the notice of noncompliance fee
until the date of payment.  Any partial payments of the noncompliance fee,
late charge, collection fee or interest received shall be applied first to
interest, then late charge and collection fee, and lastly to the
noncompliance fee.



 



   The City shall have the right to bring legal action in any court of
competent jurisdiction to enforce the order and collect the amount of these
fees.  In addition to any other remedy provided by law, the City may collect
any judgment, fee, cost, or charge, including any permit fees, fines, late
charges, or interest, incurred in relation to the provisions of this section
as provided in Los Angeles Administrative Code Sections 7.35.1 through 7.35.8.

EARTHQUAKE.



   (Added by Ord. No. 169,813, Eff. 5/10/94.)



 



   Notwithstanding any provision of the LAMC or the Los Angeles
Administrative Code to the contrary, the following provisions shall apply to
work performed to demolish, repair or rebuild a building or structure damaged
or destroyed as a result of the 1994 Northridge Earthquake and its
aftermath.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)



 



   (a)   The Department shall waive all fees which the Superintendent
of Building determines are required by Articles 1 through 8 of Chapter IX of
the LAMC to repair earthquake damage or to demolish and/or rebuild a
building, structure or portion thereof destroyed as a result of the
Northridge Earthquake Local Emergency.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff.
7/16/18.)



 



   (b)   In addition, in order to qualify for the waiver of fee as
provided in Subsection (a) above, at the time the owner makes application for
a permit to demolish or build, the owner shall certify and execute a
statement, under penalty of perjury, that any payment or settlement received
or to be received from any insurance company for the loss and/or damage
sustained from the January 17, 1994 Northridge Earthquake and its aftermath
does not or will not include the cost of permits; and that if a payment or
settlement from any insurance company does include the cost of permits, then
the owner will reimburse the City for such cost.



 



   (c)   This ordinance shall apply retroactively so as to permit the
full refund, upon submission of a claim therefor, of all fees heretofore paid
which would have been subject to waiver by the provisions of this
ordinance.  In order to qualify for such reimbursement, an owner must
certify and execute under penalty of perjury a statement as set forth in
Subsection (b) above.

   (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)



 



   No claim for refund of Department fees shall be allowed in whole or in
part unless filed with the City Clerk within 12 months from the date of
expiration of the permit/application or of any extensions granted by the
Department or within 12 months from the date of any Department or Board
action in which a valuation, as required by Chapter IX of the LAMC, is
lowered pursuant to the provisions of LAMC Section 98.0403.1.  In the case a
valuation is lowered, the refund shall be 100% of the difference paid and
what should have been paid on all fees.



 



   Insofar as the provisions of this section are in conflict with the
provisions of LAMC Sections 22.12 and 22.13, the language of this section

SEC. 98.0421.  CODE VIOLATION INSPECTION FEE.



   (Title and Section Amended by Ord. No. 181,497, Eff. 2/3/11.)



 



   (a)   Code Violation Inspection Fee.  The Department may impose a
fee equivalent to the Department's actual cost of investigation or $336.00,
whichever is less, whenever the Superintendent of Building conducts an
inspection and issues an order or notice after verification of violation(s)
of any provision(s) of the Los Angeles Municipal Code, Administrative Code or
any Ordinance or State law enforced by the Department.



 



   The fee may be imposed only after a violation is identified and
verified upon inspection by the Superintendent.  The individual(s) notified,
shall be jointly and severally responsible to ensure that the fee specified
in this section is paid to the Department.  Notification of the fee shall be
given to the property owner, person in control of the property, the actual
violator, tenant in possession and/or business operator as may be relevant
and determined by the Superintendent.



 



   (b)   Notice.  Notification of the order or notice and the Code
Violation Inspection Fee shall be sent by United States Mail in a sealed
envelope, with postage paid, addressed to the last known address of the
person cited as the address appears in the last equalized assessment roll or
delivered in person.  Service of the notice shall be deemed to have been
completed at the time of deposit with the United States Postal Service.



 



   (c)   Collection of the Code Violation Inspection Fee.  The person
cited shall remit the Code Violation Inspection Fee to the Department within
30 days of the effective date of the order or notice.  If a permit is
required in order to correct a violation stated in the order or notice, the
permit shall not be issued until the Code Violation Inspection Fee including
any late charge is paid.  Failure to pay the Code Violation Inspection Fee
within 30 days after notification will result in a late charge of two (2)
times the Code Violation Inspection Fee plus a 50 percent (50%) collection
fee for a maximum total of $1,176.00.  The Code Violation Inspection Fee is
in addition to any other applicable fee, fine or penalty specified elsewhere
in the Los Angeles Municipal Code, Administrative Code or any Ordinance or
State Law enforced by the Department.



 



   In addition to any other remedy provided by law, the City may collect
any judgment, fee, cost, or charge, including any permit fees, fines, late
charges, or interest, incurred in relation to the provisions of this section
as provided in Los Angeles Administrative Code Sections 7.35.1 through 7.35.8.



 



   (d)   Noncompliance Fee.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff.
7/16/18.)  A noncompliance fee pursuant to LAMC Section 98.0411 may be
charged.



 



   (e)   Appeals.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)  Any
person served with an order or notice may appeal the Code Violation
Inspection Fee or request a slight modification pursuant to the procedures
set forth in LAMC Section 98.0403.1.



 



   The Department or the Board may rescind or modify the Code Violation
Inspection Fee under the authority granted by LAMC Section 98.0403.1.



 



   If the appeal or request for slight modification is not filed within 30
days after the effective date of the order or notice or extensions granted
therefrom, the determination of the Department to impose a Code Violation
Inspection Fee shall be final.

SEC. 98.0501.  ALTERNATE MATERIALS, DEVICES AND METHODS OF CONSTRUCTION.



   (Amended by Ord. No. 167,969, Eff. 7/11/92.)



 



   (a)   General Approvals.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff.
7/16/18.)  The provisions of this Code are not intended to prevent the use
of any material, device or method of construction not specifically prescribed
by this Code, provided any such alternate has been approved and its use
authorized by the Department.  For the purpose of this section, "general
approval" means approval by the Department of any device, material or method
of construction which is not specifically provided for in Chapter IX of the
LAMC.



 



   The Department may grant a general approval for an alternate, provided
that the alternate is at least the equivalent of the prescribed device,
material or method of construction in the Code in terms of quality, effective
time period of fire resistance, strength, effectiveness, durability and
safety.  The Department shall require that sufficient evidence or proof be
submitted to substantiate any claims that may be made regarding the adequacy
of any alternate device, material or method of construction.



 



   The Department may accept as evidence or as general approval, for
purposes of Article 1, Chapter IX of the LAMC, valid evaluation reports on
alternate materials, devices or methods of construction developed and
published by the International Code Council Evaluation Service (ICC ES). 
These reports may be based upon data from testing agencies not approved under
LAMC Section 98.0503.



 



   The Department shall use Part III, Recognized Standards in addition to
Part II, Uniform Building Code Standards of Division 35, Article 1, Chapter
IX of the LAMC in evaluation products for approval where such standard exists
for the product or the material and may use other approved standards which
apply.



 



   The Department may also accept as evidence or as general approval, for
purposes of Article I, Chapter IX of the LAMC, valid evaluation reports
developed and published by other nationally recognized model code
organizations only under the following circumstances.  Such reports may only
be accepted if it is proven to the satisfaction of the Superintendent of
Building that the responsible organization utilizes a specially trained and
experienced engineering review staff, and its standards of evaluation are at
least equal to the Department's current evaluation standards.



 



   Before accepting an evaluation report, the Department shall first
verify that the code organization publishing the report has utilized a
testing agency acceptance system which is reasonably equivalent to the
current Department program for testing agency approval.  This system must
provide for conflict of interest safeguards, covering the agency itself, its
owners and individual employees.  These safeguards must be at least
equivalent to those applied by the Department to approved testing agencies.



 



   Before issuing general approvals based upon the evaluation reports or
accepting the evaluation reports as general approval, the Superintendent of
Building shall establish rules and regulations setting forth the procedures
and conditions for the review of evaluation reports developed and published
by the International Code Council Evaluation Service (ICC ES) or other
nationally recognized model code organizations.



 



   The Department determination on an application for general approval may
be appealed to the Board of Building and Safety Commissioners under the
applicable provisions of this article.



 



   (b)   Fees and Term of General Approvals.  (Amended by Ord. No.

LAMC, and the application for a two year renewal of a general approval shall
be accompanied by a fee as set forth in Table 5-A of this division.



 



   An application for a technical or clerical modification of a general
approval shall be accompanied by a fee as set forth in Table 5-A of this
division.



 



   The fees for new general approvals and technical modifications include
six hours of Department processing time.



 



   The fees for renewals and clerical modifications include three hours

latest approval or subsequent renewal and, when granted, will be valid for a
two year period.  Sale and installation shall conform to LAMC Section
98.0502(h).



 



   3.   The application fee for the initial review for Department
approval of an evaluation report, pursuant to Article 1, Chapter IX of the
LAMC, shall be as set forth in Table 5-A of this division.  This fee shall
be paid in lieu of any other application fee for a general approval described
in this section.



 



   A fee as set forth in Table 5-A of this division shall also be required
for Department review of any clerical or technical modifications of a valid
evaluation report.



 



   The fees for initial review of an evaluation report and for technical
modifications of, or additions to, a previously reviewed evaluation report
include six and five hours of Department processing time, respectively.



 



   The fees for clerical modifications include one hour of Department
processing time.



 



   If a general approval or renewal is based on an evaluation report
issued by a nationally recognized model code organization acceptable to the
Department, then the general approval and subsequent renewal shall be valid
one year and two years, respectively, or as long as the unrevised evaluation
report, including any renewals, is valid, whichever is less.



 



   The Department shall review the evaluation reports created pursuant to
this section and used as a basis for general approvals, prior to their
expiration in order to verify that the reevaluation due dates of the reports
remain unrevised and fully accurate in the records of the issuing model code
organization.  Evaluation reports renewed for two years shall be reviewed
bi-annually.  An administrative processing fee as set forth in Table 5-A of
this division covering the Department costs of the reevaluation review and
report distribution shall be required from the entity holding the rights to
the general approval.



 



   The fees for review of two year reevaluation reports anticipate two
hours of Department processing time;



 



   4.   The applicant shall agree in the application to pay
supplemental fees at the rate of $104.00 per hour to cover any additional
time required by the Department to process general approvals, renewals,
reevaluations or modifications which are specified in Subdivisions 1 and 3 of
this Subsection (b), and any conditional approvals pursuant to LAMC Section
98.0403.2(a)3.  Processing shall include those activities directly related
to the general approval for which application has been made and shall include
all research, review, correspondence, clerical and consultation time
pertinent to the application.  The Department may require an estimated
supplemental fee to be paid when the application is filed.  In any event,
the supplemental fee shall be paid in full prior to final action on the
application by the Department.



 



   The fees specified in this section, including supplemental fees, are
application fees and are not refundable after the Department begins
processing the application, regardless of whether the application is approved
or denied.



 



   EXCEPTION:  Supplemental fees paid in advance which are in excess of
the total actual fee are refundable.



 



   5.   All applications shall expire 12 months after the Department
begins processing the application if the request for approval of a new
material, device or method of construction has not been cleared of corrective
orders and approved.  No approval shall be issued until the application is
refiled and a new fee paid.



 



   EXCEPTION:  The Department may grant an extension of time if the
applicant submits in writing sufficient evidence that unusual conditions or
circumstances precluded the approval within the allocated time.



 



   (c)   Off-hour Processing of Evaluation Reports.  (Amended by Ord.
No. 185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)  Upon request by an applicant and accepted by
the Department, an off-hour processing fee per LAMC Section 98.0422 may be
collected for processing of evaluation reports for alternate materials.



 



   (d)   Renewal.  (Amended by Ord. No. 169,867, Eff. 7/17/94.)  Upon
expiration of an approval or upon any change in design, material, method of
construction or model designation made during the period of approval, it
shall be unlawful to sell, offer for sale or use a product until a renewal
has been approved under provisions of this section.



 



   (e)   Requests For Extension of Time.  (Added by Ord. No. 169,867,
Eff. 7/17/94.)  Request for extension of time to file for renewals or obtain
approval of general approvals, clerical and technical modifications, and
renewals shall be made within 90 calendar days following the date of

The provisions of this code are not intended to prevent the use of any
alternate material, appliance, installation, device, arrangement, method,
design or method of construction not specifically prescribed by this code,
provided that any such alternative has been approved.  An alternate shall be
approved on a case-by-case basis where the Department finds that the proposed
alternate is satisfactory and complies with the intent of the provisions of
this code and is at least the equivalent of that prescribed in this code in
planning and design, energy, water, material resource conservation and
efficiency, environmental air quality, performance, safety and the protection
of life and health.

99.01.102.1.  Submittal Documents.  Construction documents and other data
shall be submitted in one or more sets with each application for a permit. 
Where special conditions exist, the Department is authorized to require
additional construction documents to be prepared by a licensed design

   EXCEPTION:  The Department is authorized to waive the submission of
construction documents and other data not required to be prepared by a
licensed design professional.




 



99.01.102.2.  Information on Construction Documents.  (Amended by Ord. No.
185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)  Construction documents shall be of sufficient
clarity to indicate the location, nature and scope of the proposed green
building feature and show that it will conform to the provisions of this
Code, the LAMC and other relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations as
determined by the Department.  The construction document and other data
submitted to the Department for checking shall be drawn with ink or indelible
pencil, or shall be made by a reproducible process approved by the Department.



 



99.01.102.3.  Verification.  Documentation of conformance for applicable
green building measures shall be provided to the Department.  Alternate
methods of documentation shall be acceptable when the Department finds that
the proposed alternate documentation is satisfactory to demonstrate
substantial conformance with the intent of the proposed green building
measure.



 



99.01.102.4.  Official Stamp.  When construction documents and other data
fully comply with the provisions of this code, the Department shall place an
official stamp of approval on all applicable sheets of each set.



 



99.01.102.5.  Validity of Approval.  The stamping or approval of any
construction document or other data shall not be held to permit, or to be an

construction document, or other data without the Department’s approval.



 



99.01.102.8.  Validity of Permit.  The issuance of a permit is not an
approval or an authorization of the work specified therein.  A permit is
merely an application for inspection, the issuance of which entitles the
permittee to inspection of the work which is described therein.



 



   Permits issued under the requirements of this code shall not relieve
the owner of responsibility for securing required permits for work to be done
which is regulated by any other code, department or division of the City of
Los Angeles.



 



   All permits are issued subject to the following conditions:



 



   If the work described by a valid permit is prohibited by a change in
the Los Angeles Municipal Code, then such work may be completed only if the
Department determined that both substantial liabilities have been incurred,
and substantial work has been performed on site, in accordance with the terms
of that permit.  Work performed and liabilities incurred pursuant to a
demolition or relocation permit shall not be considered in determining
whether an owner may complete a building or structure for which a building
permit has been issued.



 



99.01.102.9.  Validity of Other Laws.  Neither the issuance of a permit nor
the approval by the Department of any document shall constitute an approval
of any violation of any provision of this code or of any other law or
ordinance, and a permit or other document purporting to give authority to
violate any law shall not be valid with respect thereto.



 



99.01.102.10.  Making False Statements to the Department.  Any person who
willfully or knowingly, with the intent to deceive, makes a false statement
or representation, or knowingly fails to disclose a material fact in any
documentation required by the Department, including any oral or written
evidence presented, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor.

Eff. 7/16/18.)  A fee equal to 10% of the plan check and permit fee shall be
assessed to verify compliance with the mandatory measures of this Code for
projects subject to this Code.  This fee shall be assessed on all building,
plumbing, mechanical, electrical, and grading applications.



 




   EXCEPTIONS:  A fee shall not be assessed on grading plan check
applications.

   The Superintendent of Building shall have the duty to render

intent and purpose of this Code.



 



99.01.108.2.  Authority to Require Exposure of Work.  (Amended by Ord. No.
185,587, Eff. 7/16/18.)  Whenever any work required by this Code is covered
and concealed by additional work without first having been inspected, the
work shall be exposed for examination upon written notice by the
Department.  The work of exposing and recovering shall not entail expense to
the City.

enumerated in Section 98.0105 of the Los Angeles Municipal Code.



 



99.01.108.4.  Authority to Stop Work.  Whenever any construction work is
being done contrary to the provision of any law or ordinance enforced by the
Department, the Department shall have the authority to issue a written notice
to the responsible party to stop work on that portion of the work on which
the violation has occurred.  The notice shall state that the nature of the
violation and no work shall be done on that portion until violation has been
rectified and approval obtained by the Department.



 



99.01.108.5.  Modifications.  (Amended by Ord. No. 185,587, Eff.
7/16/18.)  The Department shall have the power to hear and act upon requests
for slight modification in individual cases to the green building ordinances
of the City, and regulations under Article 9, Chapter IX of the LAMC.



 



   In granting a request for a slight modification, the Department shall
determine that the slight modification is reasonably equivalent to the code
requirement involved, that a special individual reason makes the strict
letter of the code impractical and the slight modification is in conformity
with the spirit and purpose of the code or codes involved.
