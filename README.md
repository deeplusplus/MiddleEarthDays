# MiddleEarthDays
Second bot I made.  Collaborated with a friend.  It manages a twitter bot that posts a daily update if a relevant LOTR event happened on that date and also monitors the mentions timeline to respond to user queries against dates.  In the future it would be cool to expand the calendar json.

Also have a branch to do handle user queries for a separate bot that provides LA City ordinance information.
